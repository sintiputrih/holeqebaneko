MASON ALLEN photo</p><p>Fresh off their win for Vocal Group of the Year at the 2019 CMA Awards, acclaimed country band Old Dominion just scored their eighth No. 1 single as <span class=quotations>“One Man Band”</span> ascended to the top of the Billboard Country Airplay chart.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s quite a way to end the year,”</span> enthuses Old Dominion lead vocalist and primary songwriter Matthew Ramsey. <span class=quotations>“It’s a big deal,”</span> he adds about the Vocal Group of the Year award. <span class=quotations>“To get recognition not only from fans, but from your peers and industry is very rewarding.”</span></p><p>Old Dominion has been hailed as the best country band performing today.</p><p><span class=quotations>“It’s hard to wrap your head around because we were the little guys for a long time,”</span> he says. <span class=quotations>“It took years of hard work and suddenly you find yourself in that position. It’s pretty big.”</span></p><p>You just have to look at their YouTube viewing figures to see their popularity. <span class=quotations>“Break Up with Him,”</span> from the debut album has 40 million views, while <span class=quotations>“Snapback”</span> has 20 million. <span class=quotations>“Written In The Sand,”</span> from <span class=quotations>“Happy Endings,”</span> has 24 million views, and their latest single <span class=quotations>“One Man Band,”</span> has 33 million views, and 127 million streams.</p><img width=560 height=840 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ogden_images.s3.amazonaws.com/www.mauinews.com/images/2020/01/01082112/scene-pg.-4-TommyEmmanuel-560x840.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption>Widely considered one of the greatest living acoustic guitarists, Tommy Emmanuel returns to MACC tonight at 7:30 p.m., playing Castle Theater with special guests Grank Vignola and Vinnie Raniolo. Emmanuel fuses elements from blues, country, rock, classical and Spanish music.</p><p>Heading to Maui Arts & Cultural Center on Friday, Old Dominion includes lead guitarist Brad Tursi, multi-instrumentalist Trevor Rosen, bassist Geoff Sprung, and drummer Whit Sellers. They will be joined by special guest, Australian country musician Morgan Evans.</p><p>Ramsey and Rosen were established songwriters before forming the band. Ramsey had co-written number one songs for Kenny Chesney and Sam Hunt, while Rosen had co-written hits for Blake Shelton the Band Perry.</p><p>Formed in 2007, to initially showcase the songs band members had written, they called themselves Old Dominion after the nickname of the state of Virginia.</p><p><span class=quotations>“We never really had a big conversation ‘let’s form a band,’ “</span> he explains. <span class=quotations>“We’d known each other for ever. We were all playing music together in some way, shape or form in Virginia. It was never ‘let’s make a run for it and try to get a record deal,’ we were just performing our songs and getting $50 and a free meal and free beer.”</span></p><p>From their debut EP on the band has seen their songs top the Country Airplay chart beginning with <span class=quotations>“Break Up With Him”</span> in 2015, and their singles have either sold platinum or gold. In 2016, they won the Academy of Country Music award for New Vocal Duo or Group of the Year, and two years later they won both the Academy of Country Music and the CMA’s award for Vocal Group of the Year.</p><p>Known for composing catchy songs with great hooks, with their latest album, Old Dominion has crafted their most impressive work to date, reflecting diverse influences that even include flavors of Coldplay and Bruce Springsteen.</p><p><span class=quotations>“Big, anthemic, stadium types of songs is kind of like what we’re after,”</span> he notes. <span class=quotations>“Our influences are broad. We never made an effort to be a country band. We were writing Nashville country songs which put us in that category, but when it came to production and sonics, we never wanted to limit ourselves, so we follow what we think a song calls for.”</span></p><p>One of the album’s most memorable and heartfelt tracks, <span class=quotations>“Some People Do,”</span> is the most sparse sounding with a simple piano backing.</p><p><span class=quotations>“I wrote it with Thomas Rhett,”</span> he says. <span class=quotations>“He played these really sad chords on piano and it became such an emotional experience for me. Life is a struggle and we all have hurt people and want to change and be better. I didn’t know if I could record it because I didn’t know if I could sing it (in concert) every night and go through that emotion. The reaction has been so strong. We’ve got so many messages and letters and emails how important that song is to people.”</span></p><p>* Old Dominion plays MACC’s A&B Amphitheater on Friday at 6:45 p.m. Gates open at 5:30.

Known for hits like <span class=quotations>“Feelin’ Alright”</span> and <span class=quotations>“Only You Know and I Know,”</span> in 2019 Mason toured with Stax Records’ guitar legend Steve Cropper and Maui’s Rhodes, who celebrated the New Year on Tuesday at a sold-out show performing with Fleetwood and the Island Rumours Band (Fleetwood, Rhodes and Eric Gilliom will play Fleetwood’s on Front St. again on Jan. 13).</p><p>Known as the <span class=quotations>“Piano Prince of New Orleans,”</span> Crawford is the godson of Roberta Flack and the grandson of vocalist/pianist/composer James <span class=quotations>“Sugar Boy”</span> Crawford of <span class=quotations>“Jock-A-Mo”</span> fame. His most recent album, <span class=quotations>“Dear Fats, I Love You,”</span> paid tribute to Fats Domino, with solo piano renditions of Domino’s songs.</p><p>Offbeat Magazine praised: <span class=quotations>“This pure setting allows the always-creative Crawford to interpret, reinvent, and embellish songs that listeners know so well, with his own masterful and loving touch.”</span></p><p>A Twin Cities Pioneer Press concert review noted: <span class=quotations>“Crawford is one of New Orleans’ brightest stars, a great ballad singer with a soulful, “</span>church<span class=quotations>” feel, that evokes the late, great Ray Charles.”</span></p><p>* The <span class=quotations>“Willie K & Friends BluesFest”</span> is presented at MACC’s A&B Amphitheater on Saturday.
