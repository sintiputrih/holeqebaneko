A household name as a reality star, she's helped maintain the relevance of the Hilton dynasty. However, she does have some less-famous siblings that are just as important to the Hilton regime.</p><p>While Paris and Nicole are colossal reality show stars, Barron Hilton has kept the lowest profile of the siblings. He is somewhat famous, mainly due to his food-centric social media posts. Many fans wonder about him and his relationship with his sisters - here's everything to know.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-barron-hilton-the-second-worth>How Much Is Barron Hilton The Second Worth?</h2><p>Barron certainly had the most private childhood out of all his siblings.

During the paparazzi boom of the early 2000s, round-the-clock coverage of her led to her completely revolutionalizing fashion as we know it. The sudden popularity of luxury bags and Ugg boots could not have happened without Hilton. Even the Kardashians in today's world aren't as impactful as Hilton was 20 years ago.</p><p>She's even advocated for human rights, something her haters would have never expected her to do. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Dazed Digital</a>, Paris called for a bill of rights to protect younger people.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/paris-hilton-testifying-in-the-utah-state-senate.jpg><p><a href=#>Paris is known for her friendships with stars such as Kim Kardashian</a>, but does she get along with her brother Barron?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once again, due to Barron's private life, their relationship isn't known as well as some other famous siblings.
