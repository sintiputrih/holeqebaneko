<time>09 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span><span>Marilyn Monroe is a singer and actress popularly known as one of the celebrities who pioneered the female sexual revolution in the late ’40s.&nbsp;</span><span>Her blonde hair and sexually provocative films include&nbsp;</span></span>Some Like It Hot<span>&nbsp;,&nbsp;</span>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes<span>&nbsp;, and&nbsp;</span>Niagara<span>&nbsp;earned her fame beyond her wildest dream as she became a sex symbol that women loved to hate and men loved to meet.</span></p><p><span>Her most memorable photo was the iconic pose she struck for the hit film&nbsp;</span>The Seven Year Itch<span>&nbsp;In the picture, she was wearing a white dress and standing over a wind tunnel, which blew up her skirt.</span></p><h2><strong>Marilyn Monroe’s Bio (Age)</strong></h2><p><span><span>Marilyn Monroe, whose maiden name is Norma Jeane Mortenson, was born on June 1, 1926 at Los Angeles County Hospital to Gladys Pearl Baker (née Monroe, 1902–1984).&nbsp;</span><span>Her father was never in the picture, which is why Marilyn took her mother’s maiden name.&nbsp;</span><span>Growing up was difficult for Marilyn as she had to move from one foster family to another due to her mother’s sudden mental illness.&nbsp;</span><span>She then became a state ward, allowing her to move in with three different families who later sent her back to foster care.&nbsp;</span><span>The downside was that she was sexually abused in every family she was accepted into.&nbsp;</span><span>This caused her to develop extreme self-confidence and shyness.</span></span></p><p><span><span>When she was young she always loved playing house and later found out that she was so passionate that she was sent to the cinema just to take her away from home and that is something she loved.&nbsp;</span><span>After her third foster family no longer wanted her, she agreed in 1942 to marry at the age of 16 to avoid being a ward of the state again.</span></span></p><h3><strong>acting career</strong></h3><p><span><span>She first broke into Hollywood modeling in 1944 after meeting photographer David Conover, who was still married to her husband Jimmy Dougherty.&nbsp;</span><span>Although he didn’t want to approve, she defied him and signed a modeling contract.&nbsp;</span><span>This is when she changed her color from her naturally curly brunette to blonde so she could get more modeling jobs.&nbsp;</span><span>She couldn’t break into mainstream modeling because of her hourglass shape, so she was advised to become a pin-up model.&nbsp;</span><span>Throughout her modeling career, she has been featured primarily in men’s magazines.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Her acting career began in August 1946 and it was during this time that she changed her birth name from Norma Jeane Mortenson to Marilyn Monroe.&nbsp;</span><span>Her very first film was&nbsp;</span></span><i>Dangerous Years</i><span>&nbsp;1947 and&nbsp;</span><i><span><span>Scudda Hoo!&nbsp;</span><span>Scudda Hay!&nbsp;</span></span></i><span>in 1948.</span></p><p><span><span>Throughout her career, she has been used as a sex symbol to attract more men to the theaters.&nbsp;</span><span>This was fine with her early in her career until, over time, she began to crave more serious roles.&nbsp;</span><span>However, she only had the opportunity to play a few serious dramatic roles, which were modest hits, before her untimely passing in 1962.&nbsp;</span><span>Some of their most popular films were:</span></span><i></i><i>Ladies of the Choir</i><span>&nbsp;in 1948,&nbsp;</span><i>The Fireball</i><span>&nbsp;1950&nbsp;</span><i>As Young As You Feel</i><span>&nbsp;in 1951,&nbsp;</span><i>Love Nest</i><span>&nbsp;in 1951,&nbsp;</span><i>The Prince and the Showgirl</i><span>&nbsp;in 1957,&nbsp;</span><i>Some Like It Hot</i><span>&nbsp;in 1959,&nbsp;</span><i>Let’s Make Love</i><span>&nbsp;released in 1960 and&nbsp;</span><i>Something Must Give</i><span>&nbsp;(1962 – unfinished before her death).</span></p><h2><strong>family, relationships and children</strong></h2><p><span><span>Marilyn was the kind of woman most men only dreamed of dating and indeed some were lucky enough to be in a relationship with her while very few managed to walk her down the aisle in marriage.&nbsp;</span><span>Marilyn Monroe married on June 19, 1942 when she was only 16 because children like her had to stay away from government shelters.&nbsp;</span><span>The man she married was Jimmy Dougherty, a 21-year-old factory worker who later joined the merchant marine and was sent with her to the island of Catalina.&nbsp;</span><span>In April 1944, Jim was posted to the Pacific, where he would remain for two years.&nbsp;</span><span>Out of boredom, Marilyn started looking for modeling jobs, which she got.&nbsp;</span><span>Unfortunately, the couple divorced in September 1946 because Jim didn’t want her to work as a model.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Her second marriage was to American Baseball midfielder Joe DiMaggio in 1954. Their union took place at the San Francisco City Hall.&nbsp;</span><span>This marriage was also short-lived, as Monroe filed for divorce in October 1954, just after nine months of marriage.&nbsp;</span><span>She later met the famous playwright and essayist Arthur Miller in 1955.&nbsp;</span><span>On June 29, 1956, they married in Westchester County.&nbsp;</span><span>Just like her previous marriages, they ended in divorce in 1961.</span></span></p><p><span><span>That’s what you would expect after marrying three times that she would have at least one child, sadly Marilyn Monroe never had children and it wasn’t because she didn’t try.&nbsp;</span><span>While married to Arthur Miller, the actress became pregnant twice, however, she miscarried and it was a result of the health condition she was diagnosed with as a child.&nbsp;</span><span>Marilyn had endometriosis, which made it difficult for her to give birth to her own child.</span></span></p><h2><strong>Body measurements, height, weight</strong></h2><p><span><span>It has already been established that MarilynMonroe was a striking beauty that most women only dreamed of being.&nbsp;</span><span>Her iconic hourglass shape and seemingly perfect physique make her a reference point when it comes to beauty standards even in recent times.&nbsp;</span><span>Here are their stats:</span></span></p><p><strong>Height:</strong><span>&nbsp;5 feet 4 inches (166 cm)</span></p><p><strong>Weight:</strong><span>&nbsp;53.5kg</span></p><p><strong>Body&nbsp;</strong><strong>Statistics:</strong><span>&nbsp;93.9-58.4-91.4 cm (bust-waist-hip)</span></p><p><strong>Zodiac sign:</strong><span>&nbsp;Gemini</span></p><h2><strong>Fast Marilyn Muroe facts</strong></h2><p><span><span>1. In 1949, Marilyn was the first model to pose for the first issue of Hugh Hefner’s Playboy magazine.&nbsp;</span><span>She received $50 for the picture.</span></span></p><p><span>2. She died in Los Angeles, California, USA on August 5, 1962 at the age of 36 from an overdose of a drug called a&nbsp;</span>barbiturate<span>&nbsp;.</span></p><p><span><span>3. Marilyn Munroe and Joe DiMaggio were planning to remarry before she died.&nbsp;</span><span>DiMaggio’s terms were that he stop drinking alcohol and undergo therapy.&nbsp;</span><span>He also broadened his interest in things other than baseball.</span></span></p><p><span><span>4. Marilyn was a lover of dogs.&nbsp;</span><span>The last dog she owned before her death was a Maltese given to her by Frank Sinatra.&nbsp;</span><span>In 1999, two Polaroids of the pet were auctioned for $220,000</span></span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3>Advertisement <a class=close-stky-ads onclick='if(!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers)return!1;document.getElementById("bl_banner").style.display="none"' data-cf-modified-c1d3c94328fb5dd7b6fb8a64- href=#></a><p>Copyright © 2024.
