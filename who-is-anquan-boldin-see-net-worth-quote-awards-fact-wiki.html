Previously he played for the Arizona Cardinals, Baltimore Ravens – with whom he won his first and so far only Super Bowl ring – and the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Anquan Boldin is, as of early 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Boldin`s net worth is as high as $11 million, earned through his successful career in football which began in 2003.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=anquan-boldin-net-worth-11-million></span>Anquan Boldin Net Worth $11 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Anquan grew up in his hometown, and went to Pahokee High School, where he played both football and basketball, and also excelled in track and field. Eventually he put all his efforts into football, and eventually became Florida Player of the Year, plus being named Florida`s Mr. Football in 1998.</p><p>After matriculation, Anquan enrolled at Florida State University, where he switched to playing as a wide receiver instead of quarterback, as he had in high school. Nevertheless, he found his place in the team, and in 23 games recorded 21 touchdowns and accumulated 1,790 yards.</p><p>He declared for the 2003 NFL Draft, but due to mediocre results at NL Combine, he was selected as the 54th overall pick by the Arizona Cardinals. However, he proved everybody wrong in his first game, in which he recorded 217 yards, the most receiving yards by any rookie in his first game. He played all 16 games for the Cardinals, and totalled 1,377 yards and eight touchdowns, which earned him Offensive Rookie of the Year award. The following year was rather problematic for young Anquan, as he played only in 10 games because of injuries, and had only 623 receiving yards and one touchdown. Nevertheless, he managed to recover, and in the 2005 season posted his best numbers, with 1,402 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. He played for the Cardinals until the end of the 2009 season, posting several franchise records, and what is more important, increasing is net worth to a large degree. In just 47 games he collected 300 receptions, what made him the fastest ever to post such an achievement, and also had the best receiving yards per game average in one season, 100.1.</p><p>The Cardinals then traded him to the Baltimore Ravens for third and fourth round draft picks, and upon arrival at his new club, Anquan signed a contract worth $25 million over three years, and he also had a year left on his contract with the Cardinals, making an additional $3 million. In his first season with the Ravens, he posted 887 receiving yards and seven touchdowns, and continued in the same rhythm in the next two seasons, culminating in 2012 when he won the Super Bowl ring with the Ravens, defeating the San Francisco 49ers 34-31.The following season he was sent to the San Francisco 49ers for a six round pick, and in the first season for his new team, Anquan posted 1,179 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. The same year he signed a new contract, worth $12 million, which considerably improved his net worth.</p><p>He became free agent after the 2015 season, and signed with the Detroit Lions on 28th July 2016.</p><p>So far, Anquan has posted several notable achievements and has won numerous honors, including being 10th all-time player on the list for most catches during a career, with 1,064, and three Pro-Bowl appearances, in 2003, 2006 and 2008, while in 2015 he won the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year, for his service to community.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Anquan has been married to Dionne Marie Ewan since 2009, with whom he has two sons.</p><p>Anquan is a well-known philanthropist too; he started the Anquan Boldin Foundation or Q81 Foundation, which focuses on improving life for underprivileged children. Furthermore, in 2012, Anquan spent some time in Ethiopia, alongside Larry Fitzgerald, who is also an American Football player, to create arable land by clearing rocks.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Anquan Boldin</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$11 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 3, 1980</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Pahokee, Florida, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6′ 1″ (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>101 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American football wide receiver</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Florida State University, Pahokee High School, Hinds Community College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Dion Boldin</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Anquan Boldin Jr., Ashton Boldin</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Carl Boldin, Brenda Banks</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>DJ Boldin, Carl Boldin Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/OfficialAnquanBoldin</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/anquanboldin</td></tr><tr><td>Google+</td><td>http://plus.google.com/+AnquanBoldin81</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/anquanboldin/</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2371538/</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, NFL Honors – AP Offensive Rookie of the Year</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Pepsi Next Rookie of the Year</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>He is the brother of DJ Boldin, former CFL wide receiver for the Toronto Argonauts.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Wilfork is a cousin of C.J.
