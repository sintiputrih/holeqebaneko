Due to his ten years of experience working in a native nursery, however, he was able to identify the wood and determine that the waka must have been several decades old at least.</p><p>“I knew as soon as I saw it was tōtara that it was from a much older era,” Ngarewa said.</p><p>Based on the investigation, locals believe the waka was hidden in 1869 when the Crown captured and imprisoned the members of three local tribes: the Te Pakakohi, Ngā Ruanui, and the Ngā Rauru. Ngarewa says the waka was found near the site of Kuranui Pā, an iwi — loosely translated to mean “tribe” or “people” — settlement in Pakakohi that was nearly wiped out when its land was confiscated and its men imprisoned during the New Zealand wars.</p><p>“This is not something we talk about, a tapu, because of the pain we suffered,” Ngarewa said. “But with the waka coming out and the way it was coming out, it was unfolding as part of a bigger picture. Now maybe is the time to tell our story.”</p><p>The story is that 154 years ago, British colonial forces captured a local Māori chief named Ngāwaka Taurua and imprisoned him along with several other local elders.</p><p>When they fought back against the colonizers, the Crown deemed the men’s actions treasonous, and they were treated harshly during their imprisonment. Several of the men died as a result.</p><p>What’s more, the British colonizers also confiscated and destroyed the Māori’s wakas. Now, many believe that the newly rediscovered waka was hidden around that time to keep the Crown from finding it.</p><p>“We have spent so long reclaiming ourselves after so much interference by the Crown so to rediscover a part of our missing history, particularly on the 154th anniversary, is big for us,” said Ngāti Ruanui leader Debbie Ngarewa-Packer.</p><p>The waka is undergoing restoration in New Plymouth while local community members await a decision regarding its future. Many of them hope that the waka will be put on display in a nearby museum as a reminder of the region’s past and to educate future generations.</p><p>Local author Airana Ngarewa said that he believes the discovery is an important historical relic for his hapū — a term that means a political group or clan within Māori society.</p><p>“We are quite content to see this ancient artifact, a treasure from Pakakohi, a very ancient artifact from 1869 from what we know and it’s just been sitting in the river,” Airana says</p><p>After learning about this new discovery and some of New Zealand’s history, read about the study that suggested the <a href=#>Māori may have reached Antarctica 1,200 years before Europeans</a>. Or, learn about the <a href=#>930-year-old Native American canoe pulled out of a North Carolina lake.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyurc6roGabkaO8pg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmaori-canoe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmaori-canoe.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmaori-canoe.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmaori-canoe.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmaori-canoe.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmaori-canoe.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./anitta-brings-out-two-special-guests-during-her-coachella-performance-pics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./anitta-brings-out-two-special-guests-during-her-coachella-performance-pics.html>Anitta Brings Out Two Special Guests During Her Coachella Performance Pics!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sammy-the-bull-gravano.html>Sammy 'The Bull' Gravano, The Mobster Who Betrayed John Gotti</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sammy-the-bull-gravano.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
