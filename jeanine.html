Powdered sugar isn’t something I use often, but every once in a while, I need a cup to make perfect gooey brownies or luscious cream cheese frosting. When I add it to the grocery list, I dread watching another bag sit in the cupboard as I make my way through it at an agonizing pace. But all that’s about to change! I don’t know what took me so long, but I&nbsp;finally learned how to make powdered sugar at home.

He’s the biggest cheese lover I know, but he would happily eat 2 (erm, 3…) of these vegan quesadillas and still go back for more. While this vegan quesadilla recipe includes vegan cheese, we really love it because of the fresh veggie filling. Spicy poblanos play off caramelized roasted sweet potatoes, and diced bell peppers add a delicious crunch. Served with all the fixings, it’s super flavorful and fun. Try it for a quick and easy dinner or a healthy game day snack!

With all the recipe testing that goes on in our kitchen, I hadn’t gotten around to it. But that day, a trip to the grocery store was totally out of the question. Six inches of snow had already accumulated outside, and six more were on their way. It seemed like the perfect time to cozy up in the kitchen and cook black beans from scratch. Black beans are an ingredient that I use all the time.

We’re not big football fans, but it wouldn’t be Super Bowl Sunday without Super Bowl snacks, right? If you’re watching the game on Sunday (or even if you’re not!), I hope you’ll try this recipe. I top a bed of crispy French fries with smoky plant-based chili and generous drizzles of vegan cheese. Yep, that’s right! These chili cheese fries are totally vegan. But more importantly, they’re tasty, satisfying, and really darn fun. What more could you want in a game day…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This roasted cauliflower soup recipe is rich and creamy…but it doesn’t call for any cream. Instead, the blended cauliflower creates its luscious texture—no dairy required! I’ve had this cauliflower soup recipe in my cold weather rotation for years now.

Over the last few days, a big, blustery snowstorm has turned Chicago into a winter wonderland. When Jack and I come inside from a chilly walk or shoveling snow, a hot bowl of tortellini soup is the perfect way to warm up. If you’re also craving cozy, nourishing meals right now, you’ll love this tortellini soup recipe.

I especially love making it in the winter, when basil is out of season. Of course, it doesn’t taste exactly like basil pesto (basil is more aromatic, while kale is more peppery), but it’s still delicious. Extra-virgin olive oil and pepitas make it rich and nutty, and lemon juice adds a lovely bright finish. The whole recipe requires 8 ingredients and comes together in 5 minutes, so it’s a great one to have in your back pocket.…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I love starting my day with a protein-packed breakfast like this tofu scramble! It’s energizing, flavorful, and satisfying, the sort of thing that’s guaranteed to keep me full till lunch. I think you’ll love this recipe if you’re vegan – it’s quick and easy, it’s high in protein, and it’s a great savory option given how many vegan breakfast recipes are sweet. But even if you’re not vegan, I hope you’ll give it a try. Thanks to spices, nutritional yeast, and a dash of Dijon mustard, this tofu scramble recipe is packed with flavor.
