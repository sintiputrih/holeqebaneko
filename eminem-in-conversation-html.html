He and I are talking a few days before the December 15 release of his new LP, Revival, an album that saw its run-up dominated by chatter about how much anti-Trump content it would include. And while it’s commonplace for musicians to criticize the president, it’s less common for artists of Eminem’s stature (i.e. those who risk losing red-state fans). “I’m not worried about whether people like what I say politically,” he says. “I just want to know they’re listening. As long as I have people’s ears, I have to say what I think is right.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb88ey0c001i3a61f900cxs7@published data-word-count=37><strong>I was only able to listen the new album once before talking to you, and I gotta say, hearing tracks like “Untouchable” and “Like Home,” where you’re rapping about systemic racism and politics–</strong><br>I know where you’re going.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb88f4zr001o3a61n0x97g4m@published data-word-count=21><strong>Where am I going?</strong><strong><br></strong>You want to know how I can rap about that stuff and also rap about fucking ridiculous shit.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb88f4zr001p3a61rvlmc6j5@published data-word-count=155><strong>Yeah, though maybe I’d use a different word than ridiculous.

But I’m not killing <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>Kim</span> on songs anymore — we’re good now, and she’s the mother of my daughter. The truth is that going from one subject to a completely different one is a balancing act and I’m trying to give something to everyone.

That’s not to say I haven’t matured — I’ve grown and sometimes I want to reflect that — but when I’m writing, a line will pop in my head that’s so fucking ridiculous that it’s funny, and depending on the punch lines I need and the rhyme schemes in the song maybe I’ll use it. Those are the things I’m thinking about with some lyrics, almost before the actual meaning. There’s a song on the new album, “Nowhere Fast,” and I say, “I must have got you / In somewhat of a debacle / Because some stuff that’s awful / Really don’t mean nothing. There’s a lot of shit I say in jest / That is tough to swallow.” You know, there’s a book called<a href=#> Truly Tasteless Jokes</a>; it’s all fucked up shit; it makes me laugh — and that kind of stuff is where my brain goes. I’m not saying I’ve never gone too far, but people shouldn’t be looking to me for political correctness.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb88f4zt001r3a6129oedd38@published data-word-count=57><strong>Except when you want them to, right? They involve politics more than political correctness but there are tracks on Revival where it sure seems like you’re asking people to take you seriously.</strong><br>Okay,<strong> </strong>it does depend on the song.

I can’t even watch the news anymore because it makes me too stressed out. All jokes aside, all punch lines aside, I’m trying to get a message out there about him. I want our country to be great too, I want it to be the best it can be, but it’s not going to be that with him in charge. I remember when he was first sniffing around politics, I thought, We’ve tried everything else, why not him? Then — and I was watching it live — he had<a href=#> that speech</a> where he said Mexico is sending us rapists and criminals. I got this feeling of what the fuck? From that point on, I knew it was going to be bad with him. What he’s doing putting people against each other is scary fucking shit.

I took the fact I was poor white trash and I owned it. So I could understand why people who grew up in similar situations would relate to what I was saying.

But what about artists who aren’t willing to take that risk? I’m thinking of someone like Taylor Swift, who is so good about speaking to certain issues that seem antithetical to Trump’s worldview, but then won’t take the next step and speak out about him.

I’m probably more in tune with the state of hip-hop than a lot of people think, because listening to what’s great right now pumps me up to do my own thing.

But on a technical level, I’ve been rapping for so long that — I’m not going to say it’s easy — but I can just think of more shit to rhyme with other shit. One of my regrets on<a href=#> the last album</a> was putting out verses that were too long because I couldn’t get the rhymes to stop. I kept thinking of rhymes that kept the scheme going.

And when I look out in the crowd and it’s a sea of different kinds of people — that’s one of the most gratifying feelings I get. Nothing brings people together like music and if we — white fans and black fans — can realize we all like the same things, we should be able to realize we’re not so different. That belief is always encouraging for me. The discouraging thing — I remember when I was a kid, I didn’t really believe that cops could be planting evidence or shooting unarmed black people, then to see all the evidence of it from the past few years has been sickening. The <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-16 tabindex=0>Michael Brown shooting</span> — disgusting.

I understand that everyone listens to rap, but I consider it to be black music and I respect that. The other shit you’re talking about got so blown out of proportion. The first time I got a taste of being called anti-gay was on “My Name Is” when I said, “My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high / The only problem was my English teacher was a guy.” All I was saying was I don’t swing that way.

The honest-to-God truth is that none of that matters to me: I have no issue with someone’s sexuality, religion, race, none of that. Anyone who’s followed my music knows I’m against bullies — that’s why I hate that fucking bully Trump — and I hate the idea that a kid who’s gay might get shit for it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjb88f50c00373a61mpg27j8m@published data-word-count=125><strong>Is the criticism of your music as misogynistic off base, too? &nbsp;</strong><strong><br></strong>I think it is, because I’ve had my share of experiences with women where I’ve felt a certain way and been mad enough to make songs about those feelings.

I’m still at the place where I want to lock myself in the house for two days straight and just write. I don’t know when that’ll change.

In March of 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice cleared Wilson of civil-rights violations in the shooting, though a DOJ investigation found that the Ferguson Police Department at large engaged in a “pattern or practice of unlawful conduct” that violates “the 1st, 4th, and 14th Amendments.”</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-17 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/cjb8jnwm8005j3a61fk4ms8hy@published class=annotation data-editable=text>On April 4, 2015, the white police officer Michael Slager shot and killed Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, after a routine traffic stop in North Charleston, South Carolina.

Though the rapper has said he supports gay marriage and has “no issues with” gay or transgender people, he was using anti-gay epithets in his lyrics as recently as 2014. Toward women, there’s often a lens of irony or parody between Eminem and his [often self-castigating] music, but extreme sexual aggression and violent fantasies about women are lyrical wells from which he frequently draws.</span> <span role=tooltip id=annotation-20 data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/annotation/instances/cjb8joi6d005p3a61ltc159lf@published class=annotation data-editable=text>During the peak of homophobia accusations against him, Eminem asked Elton John to perform “Stan” with him at the 2001 Grammys.
