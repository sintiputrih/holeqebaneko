This is due to EIB, a condition where exercise causes the airways to become irritated. Cold air can make that irritation worse. Exercising indoors, wearing a scarf, and warming up properly can reduce symptoms of EIB.<h2>How do I stop exercise-induced cough?</h2><p>Other suggestions for relieving symptoms of EIB include:</p><li>Warm up with gentle exercises for about 15 minutes before you start more intense physical activity.</li><li>Cover your mouth and nose with a scarf or face mask when you exercise in cold weather.</li><li>Try to breathe through your nose while you exercise.</li><h2>Do I have asthma or am I out of shape?</h2>A key difference between the two conditions is that exercise-induced asthma often causes coughing, whereas simply being out of shape is unlikely to do so. The effects of EIB also tend to peak after exercise, while people who are out of shape typically notice that their symptoms rapidly improve after stopping exercise.<h2>How do I know if I have exercise-induced asthma?</h2>Symptoms of exercise-induced asthma include wheezing, tightness or pain in the chest, coughing, and in some cases, lasting shortness of breath.
