<time>19 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Getting serious. </span><a href=#><i><span>Teen Mom 2 </span></i></a><span>alum <a href=#><strong>Kailyn Lowry</strong></a> documented her life for more than a decade on <a href=#>MTV</a>, including the birth of her first son, Isaac Elliot Rivera, on </span><i><span><a href=#>16 & Pregnant</a> </span></i><span>in 2010. However, since <a href=#>leaving reality TV</a> in May 2022, the Pennsylvania native has kept parts of her life private, including her relationship with boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Elijah Scott</strong></a>, leaving fans to wonder about Eli’s personal life.</span></p><h2>How Did Kailyn and Boyfriend Elijah Scott Meet?</h2><p><span>While she kept his identity a secret for months, Kail revealed that she had a new man in her life while promoting a vitamin company <a href=#>on social media</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Me and my boyfriend actually send pictures of Open Vitamins that we take every morning. He will send me a picture of his and I will send a picture of mine,” Kailyn explained in April 2022.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/kailyn-lowry-new-boyfriend.jpg><p><span>The “Barely Famous” podcast host had her man on as a guest during a June 2022 episode where they opened up about how they met.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kail and Elijah were <a href=#>neighbors in Delaware</a> before entering a relationship.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I had already bought my house and moved into my house before I knew that this was your house,” Elijah said at the time.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>What Is Elijah Scott’s Job?</h2><p><span>Elijah was previously in the U.S. Army. Since getting out of the military, however, he has held numerous jobs.</span></p><p><span>In 2020, the Delaware native ran his own auto repair company called Scott Auto & Motorcycle Repair. While it is unclear if his company is still in operation, Kail previously shared that her man worked in construction.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Get you someone who pours concrete by day and sings r&b by night,” she wrote over a June 2022 Instagram Story.</span></p><h2>Does Elijah Scott Have Children?</h2><p><span>While Kail shares Isaac with ex <a href=#><strong>Jo Rivera</strong></a>, as well as son Lincoln with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Javi Marroquin</strong></a> and sons Lux and Creed with ex <a href=#><strong>Chris Lopez,</strong></a> Elijah did not have children of his own when he met the Teen Mom star. However, Kail noted that kids were not off the table for their future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“Ah, I don’t know. Like the idea of starting over. My youngest [son, Creed] is about to be two,” the </span><i><span>Pride Over Pity </span></i><span>author explained of the possibility of more children during her podcast. “But my boyfriend doesn’t have kids of his own, so it could go either way.”</span></p><p>The couple’s family expanded in November 2022 when Kail and Elijah welcomed son Rio. However, Kailyn kept quiet about the birth for several months. She finally opened up about the experience in October 2023, revealing that <a href=#>it was “traumatic.”</a></p><p>“He had to go right to the NICU,” the mom of five explained on the October 13 episode of her “Barely Famous” podcast. “I literally got to hold him for maybe three seconds before they took him to the NICU.”</p><p>Kailyn also revealed that she gave birth in a hospital, rather than at home like she did with Creed, because Rio was a “high risk” pregnancy. In terms of how Elijah handled the experience, Kailyn said she was impressed at how calm her boyfriend was.</p><p>“When I asked him the other day, he was like, ‘You were freaking out and we didn’t have time with him, so I didn’t have a chance to cry and process my son being born because you were so upset,’” she shared. “I’m like, ‘He almost died.’ And Elijah’s like, ‘No, Kail. He went to the NICU.’ To me, that’s near death … It was traumatizing for me.”</p><p>Just weeks after announcing the news of baby No. 5, Kail revealed <a href=#>she’s pregnant again</a> during an October 2023 episode of her podcast “Barely Famous” featuring TikTok star Allison Kuch.</p><p>“We were not even near each other, but what are the odds? And then I guess we both came home with permanent souvenirs,” she told Allison, flashing a glimpse of her baby bump. Both Kail and Allison got pregnant during vacations to Thailand in March 2023. “I must have got pregnant right before I left and I had no idea. So when I got there, I was eating everything. My face was flushed, but I didn’t think anything of it because I was like, there’s no way. There’s no way I am.”</p><p>Kail and Elijah are currently expecting twins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJoopqhnK67brjOsKmyZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWnnbxutdJmnKWhmpa1br%2FCqKutZZqkr263yJ2qaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkailyn-lowry-boyfriend-who-is-elijah-scott-job-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkailyn-lowry-boyfriend-who-is-elijah-scott-job-kids.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkailyn-lowry-boyfriend-who-is-elijah-scott-job-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkailyn-lowry-boyfriend-who-is-elijah-scott-job-kids.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkailyn-lowry-boyfriend-who-is-elijah-scott-job-kids.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkailyn-lowry-boyfriend-who-is-elijah-scott-job-kids.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-is-rachael-emerlye-now-tushar-atra-girlfriend-age-wiki-and-instagram-bio-267127-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-is-rachael-emerlye-now-tushar-atra-girlfriend-age-wiki-and-instagram-bio-267127-html.html>Where Is Rachael Emerlye Now?
