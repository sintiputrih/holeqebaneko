We've got the scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>If you were an avid game show watcher in the early 2000s, you no doubt remember <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Weakest Link</a>. The spitfire red-headed host who would belittle and mock players was a highlight of the show, especially when she would say her catchphrase: "You are the Weakest Link! Goodbye." We all know her as "Anne" from the show, but her full name is Anne Josephine Robinson, and she's an English television presenter and journalist known for this unique hosting style.</p><p>With the American version of The Weakest Link returning to TV soon (with <a href=#>Jane Lynch</a> as its new host, natch), you may be wondering what's going on with Anne. What has she been up to in the years since she hosted the show, and what is she doing right now? Obviously, inquiring minds want to know, so we have the answers you've been searching for. Here's what Anne has been doing as of late.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is 'The Weakest Link' ex-host Anne Robinson doing now?</h2><p>Anne Robinson has been an English TV presenter and journalist for years. She hosted the British version of The Weakest Link from 2000 to 2012, and hosted the American version from 2001 to 2002 as well. Around 2001, she was diagnosed with skin cancer and had surgery to treat it, but she didn't step down from The Weakest Link on the BBC until 2012. She found a variety of roles after that throughout different sectors of the broadcast and entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><p>She hosted a satirical TV news show on BBC One called What's the Problem? With Anne Robinson as well as the interactive BBC quiz show Test the Nation. She also worked on presenting Anne Robinson's Britain for BBC One in 2016, which focused on different facets of British life.</p><p>Up until 2022, Anne was hosting another British game show called Countdown. However, she stepped down from the role seemingly amicably.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Anne has been embroiled in a few controversies since she left the game show. Most recently at the end of 2017, she was accused of victim blaming on social media when it comes to the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. She had accused women of remaining silent and not speaking up about potential sexual abuse until years after the fact. "In my day we gave them a slap, and told them to grow up!" she said of what her generation might do to "men behaving badly."</p><p>She has also come forward and expressed her opinions on transgender individuals. She believes that "a woman is someone with a vagina," according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Telegraph</a>. Her concerns stem from a belief that transgender women are a threat to cisgender women's safety. She has also defended <a href=#>J.K. Rowling's previous transphobic statements</a>.</p><p>She has continued to offer similar sentiments over the years, with statements that appear to match her more acerbic attitude in general. But it seems that otherwise, she lives a bit more out of the spotlight than she did when she hosted The Weakest Link. Anne likely won't be returning to the show anytime soon. Apparently, she has even turned down a return as a result of the show's "wokeness," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a>.</p><p><strong>If you need support, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visit </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>RAINN.org</strong></u></a><strong> to chat online one-on-one with a support specialist at any time.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpL%2Bqs8inmKVlp5qurLHSrWSloZ6geqm70q1kmqaemnqzu8GipaynnmK7sMM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2foriginal-weakest-link-host-anne-robinson-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2foriginal-weakest-link-host-anne-robinson-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2foriginal-weakest-link-host-anne-robinson-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2foriginal-weakest-link-host-anne-robinson-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2foriginal-weakest-link-host-anne-robinson-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2foriginal-weakest-link-host-anne-robinson-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./andy-cohen-accidentally-reveals-kyle-richards-breast-reduction.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./andy-cohen-accidentally-reveals-kyle-richards-breast-reduction.html>Andy Cohen Accidentally Reveals Kyle Richards Breast Reduction</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gigi-hadid-khai-hadid-malik-11-months-instagram.html>See Gigi Hadid's August Photo Dump Featuring Baby Khai on IG</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gigi-hadid-khai-hadid-malik-11-months-instagram.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
