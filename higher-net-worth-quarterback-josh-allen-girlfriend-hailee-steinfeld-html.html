Hailee Steinfeld has done the same thing for<a href=#> Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen</a>.</p><p id=par-2_50>Before the “Blank Space” artist was rumored to be writing a love story with <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Tarvis Kelce</a>, Steinfeld and Allen were the <a href=#>celebrity-athlete couple</a> making headlines. Here’s more on their relationship including who has a higher net worth the athlete or the Pitch Perfect star?</p><h2 id=h-josh-allen-s-net-worth>Josh Allen’s net worth</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-1></figure><p id=par-3_24>Allen was born in 1996 in&nbsp;Firebaugh, California to parents&nbsp;Joel and Lavonne. Allen has three siblings–a brother Jason and two sisters Makenna and Nicala.</p><p id=par-4_112>Allen&nbsp;began playing football at an early age and continued to do so at Firebaugh High School. After graduation, he attended&nbsp;Reedley College where he led the team in both passing and rushing yards. After one season at Reedley, Allen transferred to the University of Wyoming. The signal-caller was selected by the Bills with the seventh overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. Allen signed a four-year $21 million contract with the team. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a> he has a net worth of $14 million. Allen’s net worth and earnings will continue to climb in the years to come. In 2021, he signed a six-year, $258 million contract with $150 million guaranteed.</p><p id=par-5_35>Before Steinfeld, Allen was in a relationship with his <a href=#>longtime girlfriend Brittany Williams</a>. But in April 2023, Williams wiped her Instagram clean of any sign of the NFL star and unfollowed him on Instagram.</p><p id=par-6_47>The following month, he was spotted on a date in New York City with Steinfeld. Allen admitted that he was surprised at how interested people were in their romance telling the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pardon My Take</a> podcast that “the fact that anybody cares about that blows my mind.”</p><p id=par-7_40>He also discussed his feelings about when the paparazzi snapped pictures of him and Steinfeld kissing during a vacation in Mexico saying: “I just, like, felt this gross feeling. Insecurity. No privacy. [I was] like, ‘What is wrong with people?’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><h2>Hallie Steinfeld’s net worth</h2><p id=par-8_29>Like Allen, Steinfeld was born in 1996 and in California as well. She grew up&nbsp;in the&nbsp;Tarzana&nbsp;neighborhood of&nbsp;Los Angeles and is more used to the spotlight than her beau.</p><p id=par-9_53>Steinfeld has been in the entertainment industry since she was a child as she began acting when she was just 10 years old appearing in various TV programs and commercials. When she was 13 she played Mattie Ross in the movie&nbsp;True Grit, which earned her a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination.</p><p id=par-10_72>Steinfeld has also lent her voice in notable films including Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. In addition, she has a career as a singer. In 2015, she signed a recording contract and released her debut EP titled “Haiz.” In 2022, she released her second EP titled “Half Written Story.” Steinfeld has had collaborations with some star musicians like Joe Jonas and Niall Horan and was featured in Kendrick Lamar’s music video “Barely Legal.”</p><p id=par-11_15>Today Steinfeld has a net worth of $22 million, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS1qrPHnqlmppWperi70a2fZqmllr%2B1sdGbmJyjXZ%2B8tLSMmqOlnZ5itKq%2By5%2Bpop2emXqprcilnJ5lo6myqrrFnqOdZpipuq17</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhigher-net-worth-quarterback-josh-allen-girlfriend-hailee-steinfeld-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhigher-net-worth-quarterback-josh-allen-girlfriend-hailee-steinfeld-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhigher-net-worth-quarterback-josh-allen-girlfriend-hailee-steinfeld-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhigher-net-worth-quarterback-josh-allen-girlfriend-hailee-steinfeld-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhigher-net-worth-quarterback-josh-allen-girlfriend-hailee-steinfeld-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhigher-net-worth-quarterback-josh-allen-girlfriend-hailee-steinfeld-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./scott-disick-makes-out-with-christine-burke-on-yacht-pics-w206762.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./scott-disick-makes-out-with-christine-burke-on-yacht-pics-w206762.html>Scott Disick Makes Out With Christine Burke on Yacht: Pics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mugdha-vaishampayan.html>Mugdha Vaishampayan</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mugdha-vaishampayan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
