when she lost her sister Barbara in a car accident, reports said her sister had died from her injuries.&nbsp;She admitted that it had affected her a lot.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Lyssa Chapman Death Rumor</span></strong></h2><p><span>In September 2012, it was reported that LyssaChapman was involved in a serious car accident in Honolulu and she was with her daughters.&nbsp;However, there were no reports of the extent of the injuries at this time but apparently they lived through it and it was a scary time for the family as they also lost their sister Barbara in a car accident .</span></p><p><span>Her mother told TMZ: “Little Lyssa had an accident and all of our girls were in the car.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGikqajAonnCoZippZGjerS1waWgp5%2BjYrumwIywpqusmGKxpq3ToWSrrZ2kv26txp5km6epm7%2Bqsc2dZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flyssa-chapman-siblings-net-worth-death-rumor-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flyssa-chapman-siblings-net-worth-death-rumor-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flyssa-chapman-siblings-net-worth-death-rumor-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flyssa-chapman-siblings-net-worth-death-rumor-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flyssa-chapman-siblings-net-worth-death-rumor-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flyssa-chapman-siblings-net-worth-death-rumor-age-boyfriend.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./marilyn-monroe-body-measurements-kids-height-weight-facts.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./marilyn-monroe-body-measurements-kids-height-weight-facts.html>Marilyn Monroe Body Measurements Kids Height Weight Facts</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./htc-sensation-4g-review-a-sensational-smartphone.html>Display: qHD, PPI, and HDMI out through MHL - HTC Sensation 4G Review</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./htc-sensation-4g-review-a-sensational-smartphone.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
