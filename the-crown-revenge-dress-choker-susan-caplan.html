Fashion</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=e7qFS1UE8Xi data-wc=143>Vintage jewellery guru Susan was born into a family of passionate antique collectors, who had stores in Camden Passage in Islington, "so I’ve been surrounded by art and objects d’art from an early age."&nbsp;Her parents’ home was designed by revolutionary architect Walter Segal, featured a kitchen personally designed and fitted by Terence Conran and pieces by Eames, Hille and Robin Day.&nbsp;"These all deeply influenced my style and creativity and my eye for detail and appreciation of beautiful things."&nbsp;After travelling the world at 21 while working on the QE2 ocean liner, began selling antiques like her family, and found that she was especially drawn to vintage jewellery. "My namesake brand was launched in 2008 as a selection of curated collections for luxury department stores that created synergy between vintage and contemporary style and confirmed vintage fashion could be luxury," explains Susan.</p><p id=etuaNyHhq_D data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Luxe Jewellery Special: The gold jewellery that's going to at the top of every Fashion Editor's wishlist</a></strong></p><p id=esXxqAG7L5z data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>10 dainty jewellery pieces to add to your everyday collection</a></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d731ba37b6e9-susan2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eEDYQjtgQUnr data-wc=15><strong>Princess Diana arrives at the White House in her iconic 'revenge dress' and pearl choker</strong></p><p id=e0INBfMZm9sL data-wc=76>&nbsp;Her vintage treasures have graced the catwalks and covers of many publications with Cara Delevingne and Jordan Dunn wearing Susan Caplan on the runway and Claudia Schiffer, Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa all seen wearing the brand. Beyoncé and Adele both graced the cover of in Susan Caplan. "Rhianna has been a loyal supporter since the outset, we’ve been incredibly fortunate to have such loyal support from the media and fashion industry," she divulges.</p><p id=eLZfUzOEq5nE data-wc=104>So of course it was natural that when it came to sourcing the vintage jewellery Elizabeth Debicki would be wearing to play <a class=hm-link href=#>Princess Diana</a> in Netflix's fifth series of <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Crown</a></strong>, they’d turn to Susan. "We were so grateful when 's Costume Designer reached out,"&nbsp;Susan reveals, "Due to our expertise in curating jewellery, we were asked to source interpretations of the pieces that we were briefed on. Working in TV & film is quite a new chapter for us and having worked with the Costume Department on the Crown, we’ve not only built a wonderful relationship but we truly value the craft of costume design."</p><p id=e0MJ2G6g0YhG data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>7 pairs of vintage earrings that you absolutely need in your life</a></strong></p><p id=ew9NarxSzucS data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>The Crown star Elizabeth Debicki recreates one of Princess Diana's most iconic looks at the season 5 premiere</a></strong></p><p id=eqpFoRfYm96V><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ad57f3b46aac-susan1-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=eSdmUd138tcU data-wc=7><strong>Susan Caplan's replica of the infamous necklace</strong></p><p id=eHQrzReq6JNt data-wc=103>Susan's team worked with them on several of the iconic scenes and looks, so you will come across many of her vintage pieces as you watch the series. But the ultimate challenge was sourcing Diana’s iconic pearl choker which was worn with her revenge dress, "It was so important for us to get it right as it was our favourite piece,"&nbsp;says Susan. The four stranded faux pearl choker they created is inspired by Princess Diana's choker she wore at the White House as she danced with John Travolta. It features a central oval-cut brilliant jet Swarovski crystal complimented with round-cut clear crystals.</p><p id=eQCrlkokIEZ- data-wc=14><strong>We asked Susan about what the process was like to replicate the iconic necklace:&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>How did the Susan Caplan team find Diana’s ‘revenge dress’ pearl choker for The Crown?</strong></h2><p id=egibhfQsZxWz data-wc=105>"Due to the nature of the film industry needing specific requirements, I was to source an interpretation of the one she famously wore when dancing with John Travolta and of course when she was seen in the ‘revenge dress’. This meant editing a vintage necklace from our archives,"&nbsp;explains Susan, "Having been in the field of vintage jewellery for more than 40 years, I have amassed archived collections of vintage pearls and clasps, varying colours and sizes. My team and I got to work, sifting through the thousands of vintage pearls; colour and size were paramount to meet the approval of 's costume designers."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c4906ff6a22c-susan3-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=esvDFhgq2w_1 data-wc=11><strong>Susan Caplan has over 40 years experience working with vintage jewellery</strong></p><p id=eq1Omp-ive_d data-wc=76>"Then there was the challenge of sourcing the centrepiece, changing the discoloured stones to sparkling clear ones - to complete the look we delved into another of our archived collections - thousands of Swarovski crystals (our go to) dating back to the 1930's all in their original packaging. We found the perfect supersized oval faceted gem - finally putting the strands of pearls together with the centrepiece to complete the look. A satisfying moment, challenge completed."</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Why do you think Princess Diana and her jewellery is still so captivating?</strong></h2><p id=eSctZtcMzhTY data-wc=46>"Diana was loved by so many. She is a true icon - a symbol of kindness, fashion and beauty whose legacy continues today. Her style and how she accessorised with jewellery was full of bold yet understated elegance which is still celebrated today by all generations."</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What jewellery trends do you think Princess Diana will inspire now that The Crown season five&nbsp;has premiered?</strong></h2><p id=eIjOT9aj70z6 data-wc=79>"The pearl trend will undoubtedly continue in all forms whether it be with understated or statement pieces. Pearls have the power to evoke an air of timelessness whilst enhancing any look. I'm also certain that the supremely decadent trend of bold crystals will thrive as we’ve seen on the SS23 runways. A huge amount of our collections feature Swarovski crystals, some taken from our archived collections allowing us to redefine opulence and share these vintage pieces with our consumers."</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>What should we bear in mind when it comes to starting our own vintage jewellery collection?</strong></h2><p id=eZO08EPHoXwr data-wc=94>&nbsp;"I would suggest doing a volume of research, acquiring a vintage collection takes a huge amount of historical knowledge and expertise which can be learnt through books, antique markets and at auction houses to name a few. Familiarising yourself by handling and looking at the pieces is very helpful. I would also always encourage going to a reputable vintage source to ensure authenticity. In terms of specifics, if you find a piece you love, check it`s condition. Condition is always important. And finally, enjoy it, it’s a beautiful passion full of history and stories!"</p><p id=eTvKSYSMyWY6 data-wc=7></p><p id=ejeI5UkLcD-p data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5FpaWtpYWZ9coGVcGltZ6Sdsm6v0aiup2WimsOmusaeZJ2qlajAbq%2FHqKKeql2owrStzWaamqiclrtw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-crown-revenge-dress-choker-susan-caplan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-crown-revenge-dress-choker-susan-caplan.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-crown-revenge-dress-choker-susan-caplan.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-crown-revenge-dress-choker-susan-caplan.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-crown-revenge-dress-choker-susan-caplan.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-crown-revenge-dress-choker-susan-caplan.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./skyrah-bai.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./skyrah-bai.html>Skyrah Bai</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./new-support-characters-join-pokken-tournament-growing-roster.html>New Support Characters Join Pokken Tournaments Growing Roster</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./new-support-characters-join-pokken-tournament-growing-roster.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
