On the bright side, it is abundantly clear that there are millions of massive Kardashian/Jenner fans who are overjoyed that they have gotten to watch the family’s antics on television for many years now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though there are so many people who seemingly can’t get enough of the Kardashians and Jenners, that doesn’t mean that any of those people would claim they are perfect. In fact, as it turns out, the biggest fans of the Kardashians and Jenners are the ones who have the most complaints about them as well.</p><p>Of course, it makes perfect sense that the biggest Kardashian and Jenner fans are the ones who have the most complaints about the family. After all, it is a lot harder to be bothered by Kris, <a href=#>Khloe</a>, Kendall, <a href=#>Kourtney</a>, Caitlyn, <a href=#>Kylie</a>, and Kim if you don’t watch their shows. However, that does beg an obvious question, what is it about the Kardashians and Jenners that is irritating their biggest fans?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian Was Giving Away Toilets And Fans Are Shocked By Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=controversial-clan>Controversial Clan</h2><p>Ever since they found themselves in the spotlight, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Kardashian/Jenner family have inspired one controversy after another</a>. In total fairness to the popular family, a lot of those controversies were pretty ridiculous. For example, most of the controversies that revolve around superficial aspects of the Kardashians and Jenners are pretty brutal since they shouldn’t be judged for their looks. However, all of the complaints about cultural appropriation are perfectly valid.</p><p>When it comes to the valid complaints about the Kardashians and Jenners, there are a lot of examples including Kendall’s Pepsi ad and Kim’s “blackface” incident. It also has to be noted that a lot of people take serious issues with Caitlyn and Kanye’s political beliefs. However, this article isn’t about serious issues like those. After all, it would be insensitive to refer to things that actually matter like all of those as just irritating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Believe This Kylie Jenner Style Era Was ‘Cultural Appropriation Influenced By Tyga’</a></span></p><h2 id=so-many-frustrations>So Many Frustrations</h2><p>For the biggest fans of the Kardashian and Jenner family, there are a lot of different places for them to discuss them online. For example, any time the Kardashians and Jenners are in the news or one of their shows is airing, they almost instantly begin to trend on Twitter. However, Twitter tends to be the best place to discuss or rant about the Kardashian/Jenner news of the moment. For example, when the Kardashians and Jenners are fighting in public, Twitter is a wonderful place to go to address the drama.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Social Media Commentators Call Out 'Double Standard' As Kylie Jenner Announces Baby #2</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For Kardashian and Jenner fans who want to address longer-term things about the family, Reddit is a lot better option. With that in mind, it makes sense that a fan of the family went on the r/KUWTK subreddit to ask a very specific question. “What is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the most minor thing about the Kardashians that annoys you</a> when it shouldn't because its silly and harmless. Like i'm talking really minor, not appropriation, tone-deafness, anti-vaxxer.”</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the aforementioned Reddit thread had loads of replies. However, considering that certain replies got loads of upvotes, it is pretty clear that they are the things that bother the Kardashian and Jenner fans the most. For example, the reply with the most votes by a huge margin was “The way they get mad about someone having similar furniture and clothes as them”. In response, Reddit users cited examples of that like when Kim was mad Kourtney copied her Christmas lights and Khloe resenting Kriss putting pictures of Marilyn Monroe up in her home. Considering that the Kardashians and Jenners have delighted in dressing up as one another in the past, it is puzzling that they get so mad when they dress or decorate alike.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the fans who replied to the aforementioned Reddit thread, there are a lot of other minor things about the Kardashians and Jenners that are bothersome. For example, the reply with the second most upvotes was about the sisters having “beef lips” because they’ve injected too much filler. The next most upvoted complaint was about Kendall laughing during serious conversations being irritating since it makes it seem like those discussions are “clearly scripted”.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another complaint about the Kardashians/Jenners is that they wish people happy birthday on social media alongside photos of themselves instead of images that include the person they are celebrating. Also, fans of the family are bothered by Khloe’s KLOCD, Kim’s poor grammar, Khloe stroking her hair, overusing filters on social media, and the length of their nails. Amazingly enough, that is just a small sampling of the complaints people wrote about in the aforementioned Reddit thread.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian's Hair Colors, Ranked</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1doK6zsMCsn6KZnqh6or7EZqmemZyhxm6tzaemsqGenHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-kardashians-are-really-annoying.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-kardashians-are-really-annoying.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-kardashians-are-really-annoying.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-kardashians-are-really-annoying.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-kardashians-are-really-annoying.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-kardashians-are-really-annoying.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tommy-lee-posts-bikini-pic-of-brittany-furlans-100-natural-body.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tommy-lee-posts-bikini-pic-of-brittany-furlans-100-natural-body.html>Tommy Lee Posts Bikini Pic of Brittany Furlans 100% Natural Body</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./silas-randall-timberlake.html>Silas Randall Timberlake- Meet Eldest Son Of Musician Justin Timberlake and His Actress Wife, Jessic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./silas-randall-timberlake.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
