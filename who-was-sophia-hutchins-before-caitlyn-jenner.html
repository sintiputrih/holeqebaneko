She's also promoting her sunscreen product line, Lumasol, reminiscing on Insta about her family and friends, and telling fun <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stories about Caitlyn Jenner</a> in interviews. She's come a long way from her Seattle roots, but her life experiences growing up made her who she is today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hutchins is becoming a success in her own right, and her connections to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rich and famous Kar-Jenner family</a> make it easier for her to achieve her goals. She started out life as a baby boy but realized when she got a bit older that she just wasn't at peace in her body. She felt female on the inside.</p><p>Her decision to transition was inspired by the transition journey that Caitlyn Jenner took. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophia Hutchin's story is amazing</a>, and it starts in childhood, so let's turn back the clock now.</p><h2 id=she-was-brave-enough-to-make-a-big-change><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>She Was Brave Enough To Make A Big Change</span></h2><p>It takes guts to go on hiatus from college in order to transition, and then to return to college with a whole new image. That's what gutsy Sophia Hutchins did. She used to be known as a male and came back to college as her true, inner self, with the feminine look that she always wanted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sophia did worry about being heckled upon her return but had the courage to transition, despite the potential bullying. We only get one shot at life, unless you're a believer in reincarnation, so it's inspiring that Sophia took the reins and became her best self. We can all learn a thing or two from her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Photos Of Sophia Hutchins Before She Got Together With Caitlyn Jenner</a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=she-used-to-be-called-scott-hutchins><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>She Used To Be Called Scott Hutchins</span></h2><p>When Sophia was Scott, Scott was a big cheese on campus <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at Pepperdine University</a>. Scott Hutchins helped the LGBTQ+ community at his university, by chairing its LGBTQ+ committee.</p><p>If you thought Sophia Hutchins was just another hanger-on, who is building a career solely based on knowing the Kardashians, think again. Sophia has a long history of fighting for social justice and also served as SGA Junior Class President at Pepperdine, before resigning to embark on transition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=caitlyn-jenner-became-her-inspiration><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Caitlyn Jenner Became Her Inspiration</span></h2><p>Pepperdine is in California, where the Kar-Jenners work and play. However, Sofia (then Scott Hutchins) was inspired by Caitlyn Jenner before becoming a part of Caitlyn's inner circle. Kris Jenner's ex made quite an impact on young Scott and helped him find the bravery to transition. Not that Scott, who is now the beautiful and successful Sophia, didn't have plenty of courage already.</p><p>It's nice to know that Caitlyn's been a positive role model for people like Sophia.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Caitlyn Jenner May Be Close With Her Daughters But She Gets Too Personal For Sophia Hutchins</a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=sophia-dreamed-of-being-a-model><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Sophia Dreamed Of Being A Model</span></h2><p>Sophia was a great college student who also excelled in the realm of student politics. However, like many of us, she had dreams that were on the glamorous side. Yes, she wanted to be a model, ever since the days when people called her Scott and perceived her as male.</p><p>Luckily, Sophia is a go-getter who had the moxie to pursue her dreams and make them a reality. She has modeled, and her achievements definitely don't stop there. She's living proof that people can hit their goals if they want success badly enough, and are willing to work hard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sophia looks gorgeous in her modeling pics! A lot of people think she's practically Ivanka Trump's twin, thanks to her long blond hair, fair skin, and fine features.</p><h2 id=she-also-dreamed-of-business-success><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Also Dreamed Of Business Success</span></h2><p>Modeling is fun and can be lucrative, but business often provides benefits that last for longer. Savvy Sophia knows this, and she planned to conquer the business world by becoming an entrepreneur with blue-chip Kar-Jenner connections.</p><p>In the pic above, you can see Sophia Hutchins serving up a sultry, smoldering pose in a shiny red Ferrari. Sophia wants the best in life and plans to use the business acumen she acquired at Pepperdine to get it. She's working hard to make her new sunscreen brand, Lumasol, a rousing success. We know she's going to succeed!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-involved-with-student-politics-at-university><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>She Was Involved With Student Politics At University</span></h2><p>Adorable as Scott and stunning as Sophia, this business mogul in the making has always been impressive. In the pic above, you can see Caitlyn's future friend on campus at Pepperdine, dressed in a preppy button-down shirt, jeans, and moccasins. We recognized that cute and radiant smile right away! It's been great watching Sophia evolve through the years. She is a total inspiration to all of us!</p><h2 id=this-picture-was-shared-right-before-the-transition><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>This Picture Was Shared Right Before The Transition</span></h2><p>Before letting the world know that he planned to transition, Scott Hutchins wrote a moving essay and posted the pic above to accompany his words. Scott was ready to transition...and be who he always wanted to be.</p><p>Scott resigned from the student council at Pepperdine because he needed to take time out to transition. Scott knew he felt female since he was very young. It was time to engage with others as a female. This is a pic of a courageous person on the brink of a big life change.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Sweet Facts About Sophia Hutchins And Caitlyn Jenner</a>&nbsp;</span></p><h2 id=she-may-be-a-cougar-today><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She May Be A Cougar Today</span></h2><p>Sophia isn't so old herself. She's in her early twenties but is believed to have a taste for guys who are on the younger side. Is Sophia a cougar? Maybe so.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This inspiring activist does have a romantic life, but not with Caitlyn Jenner. She actually thinks of Caitlyn as more of a parental figure. In fact, she once had to get a lock installed on her bedroom door because she shares a home with Caitlyn...and Caitlyn barged into her room without knocking! Sophia was entertaining a male friend when Caitlyn burst through the door, according to People.</p><h2 id=soon-enough-life-got-way-more-glam><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Soon Enough, Life Got Way More Glam</span></h2><p>We live in a culture where getting glam is celebrated because it's a nice way to escape from problems and focus on a little fantasy and fashion. Glowing up can also be great for self-esteem, as long as makeup, hair, and clothes aren't all that a person is about.</p><p>Sophia loves getting glam, and she did a deep dive into the glam celeb lifestyle when she started hanging around Caitlyn. She actually got to know Caitlyn because they shared a hairdresser.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Becoming friends with Caitlyn totally changed her life! However, Sophia was making her mark in the world before Caitlyn came along. Sophia is her own person.</p><h2 id=people-thought-she-and-caitlyn-were-an-item><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>People Thought She And Caitlyn Were An Item</span></h2><p>Yes, rumors that these two were hot and heavy were everywhere, until Sophia finally stopped being coy and spelled out the truth of the situation, which is that she and Caitlyn are just friends.</p><p>They also work together. Sophia handles some business matters for her older friend. As mentioned, they also live together, in a luxurious home with all of the bells and whistles. These two are joined at the hip but don't get physical in a romantic way. Maybe their relationship will stay strong because they haven't gotten romantic. Sometimes, romances don't last as long as good friendships.</p><h2 id=but-it-s-all-about-friendship-and-business><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>But It's All About Friendship And Business</span></h2><p>Sophia is so loyal to Caitlyn. Sophia is a Taurus and they are known for sticking with things and people through thick and thin. Caitlyn is a Gemini, who's a little more fickle in terms of interests and friends. Together, these two balance each other out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sophia uses her practical Taurus nature to help Caitlyn organize her life and make money. Caitlyn uses her social skills, talents, and past achievements to bring glitz and excitement to her younger friend's life. This connection is 'win-win' - it's a great platonic and business relationship that we absolutely love!</p><h2 id=she-had-the-courage-to-spread-her-wings-and-fly><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>She Had The Courage To Spread Her Wings And Fly</span></h2><p>If there's one thing we love to see, it's someone being their true self and loving life. Happiness is a choice and Sophia has made the decision to live a joyful and authentic life. She is an awesome person!</p><p>She's got more depth than you might think, and we hope that reading this list has helped you to learn more about her and appreciate her many strengths. She's more than just a member of the Kar-Jenner entourage.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kar-Jenners: 15 Surprising Things Their Exes Have Said About Them</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddrK60edKop6GhkWK1tsDCoaCnq12Xsqe70Z5knJmZqbm6uoyjnKemlad8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-was-sophia-hutchins-before-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-was-sophia-hutchins-before-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-was-sophia-hutchins-before-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-was-sophia-hutchins-before-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-was-sophia-hutchins-before-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-was-sophia-hutchins-before-caitlyn-jenner.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./edie-falco-net-worth-141359.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./edie-falco-net-worth-141359.html>Edie Falco Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lea-seydoux.html>Lea Seydoux Net Worth, Age, Height, Bond, Movies List</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lea-seydoux.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
