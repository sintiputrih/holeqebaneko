<time>20 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Lance Kerwin, a former child actor who starred in the TV miniseries Salem’s Lot and other popular shows in the 1970s, passed away on January 24, 2023, at the age of 62. His daughter Savanah announced his death on Facebook, but did not reveal the cause of his death. According to Distractify, Kerwin had suffered from various health issues, including a back injury and some other unnamed problems.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Prolific Career Cut Short</strong></h2><p>Kerwin began his acting career at a young age, appearing in various TV shows such as Little House on the Prairie, Wonder Woman, and The Bionic Woman. He also starred in several ABC After School Specials, an anthology series that tackled issues relevant to kids and teens. According to CNN, one of his most notable roles was as James in the NBC drama series James at 15 (later changed to James at 16), which was praised for its realistic portrayal of teenage life.</p><p>However, Kerwin is perhaps best remembered for his role as Mark Petrie in Salem’s Lot, the 1979 TV adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, directed by Tobe Hooper. In the miniseries, he played a young boy who helps defend his town against a horde of vampires. The miniseries was a hit with both critics and audiences, and became a cult classic among horror fans. Kerwin’s performance earned him regular invitations to horror conventions, where he shared his memories of working with legendary actors like James Mason.</p><p>Kerwin’s acting career slowed down in the 1980s, as he struggled with drug addiction and personal problems. He later became a born-again Christian and moved to Hawaii with his wife Yvonne and their four children. He also had a daughter from a previous relationship. He made a brief comeback in 1995 with a role in Outbreak, and then again in 2022 with a role in The Wind and the Reckoning.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>A Legacy of Love and Faith</strong></h2><p>Kerwin’s death has saddened many of his fans and friends, who have expressed their condolences and tributes on social media. His daughter Savanah wrote on Facebook that her father loved everyone and was grateful for his life. She also asked for prayers for her family as they cope with their loss.</p><p>In June 2021, a friend of Kerwin’s started a GoFundMe page to help him get back on his feet after his health issues. In response, Kerwin posted a heartfelt thank you message on the page, where he expressed his appreciation for his friends and his faith in God. He also praised his children, whom he called his greatest blessing.</p><p>“They have their mom’s spark, her beauty, and sense of humor. Really, they don’t have much from me [but] I’m gonna do my best to give them the best of me,” he wrote.</p><p>Lance Kerwin’s cause of death may not be known yet, but his legacy of love and faith will live on through his family and fans. He will be missed by many who grew up watching him on screen and admired him for his talent and courage. Rest in peace, Lance Kerwin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfoa6vr8Rmop6qp567bq%2FArqqeZZ%2BbeqWxwK2fZp6fp7qmvoycn6KklGLAta3RZpuinaNirrV5lWtm</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flance-kerwin-cause-of-death-former-child-star-dies-at-62.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flance-kerwin-cause-of-death-former-child-star-dies-at-62.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flance-kerwin-cause-of-death-former-child-star-dies-at-62.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flance-kerwin-cause-of-death-former-child-star-dies-at-62.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flance-kerwin-cause-of-death-former-child-star-dies-at-62.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flance-kerwin-cause-of-death-former-child-star-dies-at-62.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./emma-appleton.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./emma-appleton.html>Who is Actress Emma Appleton?
