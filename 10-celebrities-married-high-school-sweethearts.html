There are celebrities who continue to be happily married with their high school sweetheart, while others ended their relationships in divorce. It makes you wonder whether or not fame had anything to do with the break-up of some of these couples. Let’s check out some of the celebrities who decided to say “I do” to their adolescent love.</p><p>(Photo by Dan MacMedan/WireImage)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Jeff-Daniels-and-Kathleen-Treado.jpg alt="HBO's Annual Primetime Emmy Awards Post Award Reception" width=640 height=426 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Jeff Daniels and Kathleen Treado</strong></p><p>While Daniels married his non-showbiz love when they were both 24, they actually met while attending high school in Michigan and sparks were flying then. The couple continues to stay strong with three children as the whole family moved back to their hometown where it all started.</p><p>(Photo by Rodrigo Vaz/FilmMagic)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Bono-and-Ali-Stewart.jpg alt="2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Graydon Carter - Arrivals" width=639 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Bono and Ali Hewson</strong></p><p>Everybody knows that being married to a rock star is quite difficult. Bono could have easily succumbed to the hedonistic lifestyle of rock n’ roll, but his wife Ali keeps him grounded. These two were childhood sweethearts in Ireland and they tied the know in 1982. He married at a young age of 22.</p><p>(Photo by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Jon-Bon-Jovi-and-Dorothea-Hurle.jpg alt="2014 Food Bank Of New York City Can Do Awards" width=641 height=481 sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Jon Bon Jovi and Dorothea Hurley</strong></p><p>Here’s another reason to revitalize your belief in getting hitched with rock stars. Bon Jovi and Hurley actually dated for four years in high school. The best part is that the musician actually took time off touring to elope with his sweetheart in Las Vegas secretly. They are currently together and proud parents of four kids.</p><p>(Photo by Desiree Navarro/WireImage)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Snoop-Dogg-and-Shaunte-Taylor.jpg alt="10th Annual Harold Pump Foundation Gala - Inside" width=636 height=424 sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Snoop Dogg and Shaunte Taylor</strong></p><p>Not all marriages are perfect and smooth sailing. Snoop met his lady love back in high school and they were hitched in 1997. They have three kids together. However, he filed for divorce in 2004 citing irreconcilable differences. The good news is that their divorce didn’t push through and they renewed their vows fours years later.</p><p>(Photo by Tiffany Rose/WireImage)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Robin-Thicke-and-Paula-Patton.jpg alt="56th Annual GRAMMY Awards - Arrivals" width=638 height=448 sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>Robin Thicke and Paula Patton</strong></p><p>Thicke and Patton actually met at a teen night club in 1993. They dated throughout their time in high school and in college. In 2005, they got married and had their first son five years later. Unfortunately, the two decided to split in February 2014 and many speculate that it had to do with Robin’s antics with Miley Cyrus and female fans posing for a photo.</p><p>(Photo by Dan MacMedan/WireImage)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/LeBron-James-and-Savannah-Brinson.jpg alt="The 2013 ESPY Awards - Audience" width=637 height=516 sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>LeBron James and Savannah Brinson</strong></p><p>These two aren’t married yet, but they’ve been together since they were in high school. They even have two sons together to keep them company. Marriage is definitely in their trajectory since the athlete popped the question on New Year’s Eve 2011.</p><p>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for ESPY)</p><p><span><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Ron-Howard-and-Cheryl-Alley.jpg alt="The Orange British Academy Film Awards 2009 - Soho House / Grey Goose After Party" width=632 height=435 sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><strong>Ron Howard and Cheryl Alley</strong></p><p>Howard may have a number of films under his belt, he’s proud to have one lady love for the majority of his life. He and Alley actually had a forbidden romance thing going on and they would often sneak out just to see each other. The couple married in 1975 when both of them were only 21 years old.</p><p>(Photo by Stuart Wilson/Getty Images)</p><p><span><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Russell-Wilson-and-Ashton-Meem.jpg alt="The 2013 ESPY Awards - Arrivals" width=629 height=943 sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><strong>Russell Wilson and Ashton Meem</strong></p><p>Football star Russell Wilson met Ashton Meem at a high school party and were together ever since. They even managed to stay together when they went to colleges that were really far from one another. Meem did transfer to a closer school later on to be closer to her boyfriend. The couple got married in 2012, but it sadly ended in divorce last month.</p><p>(Photo by Frederick M.

The actress admitted that they chose the venue to keep the ceremony a secret and they only had a few witnesses present. They got married in 2003, but the duo eventually sought for divorce in 2011.</p><p>(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)</p><p><span><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Mitt-Romney-and-Ann-Romney.jpg alt="Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney Holds Election Night Gathering In Boston" width=635 height=423 sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></p><p><strong>Mitt Romney and Ann Davies</strong></p><p>The politician actually met his future wife when they were both in elementary school. However, Mitt only asked Ann out when they were teenagers. Their first date was to see&nbsp;The Sound of Music&nbsp;in theaters. It seemed that he was convinced that Ann was the one when he informally proposed to her during their high school prom. They married four years later in 1969 and have been going strong ever since with a large family of their own.</p><p>(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2K6or7RopydZZietKl50pyfqKecYsC4scStn56ZoqnAcA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-celebrities-married-high-school-sweethearts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-celebrities-married-high-school-sweethearts.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-celebrities-married-high-school-sweethearts.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-celebrities-married-high-school-sweethearts.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-celebrities-married-high-school-sweethearts.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-celebrities-married-high-school-sweethearts.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bad-vs-wild-is-already-looking-like-nick-cannons-version-of-fight-club.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bad-vs-wild-is-already-looking-like-nick-cannons-version-of-fight-club.html>Bad vs. Wild is already looking like Nick Cannons version of Fight Club</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./woody-allen-net-worth-details-about-movies-career-age-income-salary-html.html>Woody Allen Net Worth: Details About Movies, Career, Age, Income, Salary</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./woody-allen-net-worth-details-about-movies-career-age-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
