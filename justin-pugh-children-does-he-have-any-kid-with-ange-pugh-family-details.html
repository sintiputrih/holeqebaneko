Although Herrod initially asked Manilow to put a few songs together for a musical, Barry composed an original score instead. His score was accepted, and the play ran for eight years. During these early years, Barry also earned money by writing jingles for various commercials. He also sang on many of these jingles. He would later state his time composing jingles helped him become a successful pop singer.</p><p>By the end of the 60s, Barry was given a record deal by Tony Orlando, the vice president of Columbia/CBS Music. Although he initially failed to make much of an impact in the mainstream music industry, Manilow took a major step forward when he became Bette Midler’s pianist, accompanying her on albums such as “The Divine Miss M” and “Bette Midler.” This earned Barry a Grammy nomination in 1973. Also in 1973, he released a self-titled album before coming out with a breakthrough hit in 1975 entitled “Mandy.” This was included on Manilow’s second album, “Barry Manilow II.”</p><p>After releasing “Mandy,” Manilow continued with a range of hits throughout the years. These were included on multi-platinum albums such as “Tryin’ to Get the Feeling,” “This One’s For You,” “Even Now,” and “One Voice.” He also became a popular entertainment figure, starring in the 1985 television movie “Copacabana.”&nbsp;Justin Pugh and Ange Pugh are expecting a child on January 24, 2024.
