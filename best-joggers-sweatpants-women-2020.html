The soft coziness is seriously heaven-sent for lounging, especially in the fall and winter weather. The only issue is their wearability in the real world. You can totally wear sweats to run a quick errand or walk the dog, but when you’re hanging out with people or heading downtown, you’re probably going to change to something else.</p><p>The good news, however, is that sweats are starting to seriously show themselves as fashion staples too, thanks to new trends like athleisure that embrace coziness for its chic potential. That’s how joggers were born. There are so many sweatpants and joggers on the market now that not only feel soft like a cloud but look like a million bucks.
