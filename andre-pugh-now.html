The couple frequently argued about the fact that Pugh regularly stepped out on his relationship, which prompted Tiffany to bring up the possibility of divorce.</p><p>On the evening of Nov. 23, 2014, Tiffany was found shot to death in the home she shared with Pugh outside of Atlanta. When East Point police arrived on the scene, they discovered the couple's two-year-old child draped across his mother's body, begging her to please wake up, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>. Could her husband have been involved in a murder that his own child might have witnessed, and where is Andre Pugh now? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/Dateline NBC</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Before we get to where Andre Pugh is now, let's discuss what happened to Tiffany Pugh.</h2><p>When Pugh called 911 to report that something happened to his wife, he did so from their driveway. He never entered the house but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he tells the 9-1-1 operator</a> that he "thinks his wife's been murdered." The police found Tiffany's body in the couple's guest room, which certainly supported the idea that they were having marital issues. Their son was screaming over his mother's lifeless body. What happened was meant to look like a home invasion, but police weren't buying it.</p><p>Before Pugh was a suspect, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">police took a statement</a> about what happened the morning of Tiffany's death. He told them that he went home after being alerted that his alarm was going off. Pugh called his boss and asked him to stop by the house and turn it off so as not to wake his children. Upon arriving home, Pugh initially thought Tiffany was sleeping but changed his mind when he found broken glass downstairs. He immediately exited his house which made law enforcement suspicious. Why would he leave his children in the home?</p><p>While being interrogated by police, Pugh was asked if the cell phone he was carrying was the only on he owned. "Yes," he told them while handing it over. However the next day, authorities learned Pugh had a second cell phone. They quickly obtained search warrants in order to request records for both cell phones from Sprint, Pugh's provider. They also secured a "tower dump of phone numbers used on the Sprint cell phone tower near Pugh's residence around the time of the crime," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pugh v. State</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/Fox 5 Atlanta</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Andre Pugh hired his best friend to kill his wife.</h2><p>What police discovered via the tower dump and Pugh's secret phone helped them zero in on a second suspect. Pugh had been communicating with his best friend, Adrian Harley, whose cell phone placed him at the Pugh house immediately before the murder. The other person close to the house around the time Tiffany was killed, was Pugh himself. Police arrested Pugh and Harley on Dec. 5, 2014.</p><p>Details of what happened the night Tiffany was killed were revealed during Pugh's trial. Pugh immediately turned on his best friend and told police it was all him. That part wasn't true, but Harley killing Tiffany was. On the night of the murder, Harley "entered the home through a back window, walked into the guest bedroom where Tiffany was sleeping and shot her multiple times with a revolver before escaping and leaving her body for one of her small children to find," per 11 Alive News.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> reported that in October 2018, Pugh was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. He is currently serving his sentence at Telfair State Prison, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections. Harley was convicted of felony murder, aggravated assault, conspiracy to commit murder, and possession of a firearm. He was also sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrulvsRmp66fmGK7sMM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fandre-pugh-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fandre-pugh-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fandre-pugh-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fandre-pugh-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fandre-pugh-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fandre-pugh-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./hadron-engine-ability.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./hadron-engine-ability.html>Hadron Engine (Ability) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./french-montana-net-worth.html>French Montana Net worth : Career &amp;amp; Pets</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./french-montana-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
