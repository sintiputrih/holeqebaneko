Don’t believe us? Well then take a peek at his Mission: Impossible co-star Simon Pegg recently posted on his Instagram.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The picture, which seems to carry with it many questions, shows Simon Pegg cuddling with Tom Cruise and their other <a href=#>co-star</a> Rebecca Ferguson. Cruise is shirtless while Pegg and Ferguson are draped all over him. Pegg has even included the caption, “Chilling between shots. Standard formation.” This is where the questions arise.</p><p>It is known that Cruise, Ferguson, and Pegg are currently shooting MI:7, and quite possibly MI:8 back-to-back, but in the posting of this cuddly pic, Pegg has included #roguenation. For those of you keeping score, Rogue Nation was the <a href=#>fifth entry</a> in the series, sandwiched between the two hits Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol from 2011 and the most recent venture, Mission: Impossible – Fallout from 2018. So, what gives, Pegg? Are we looking at a recent pic from the set of MI:7 or did take a turn back in time to the Rogue Nation set? While we ponder a possible (or Impossible) answer to the posed question, another good one comes to mind. Tom, just where the hell are your legs?</p><p>Tom Cruise made his first two Mission: Impossible films as IMF agent Ethan Hunt sans Simon Pegg. The comedic actor joined Cruise as master IMF tech whiz Benji Dunn on Mission: Impossible III, a film that brought J.J. Abrams into the MI fold, though that would last for only one film. Whew! Pegg would continue to partner up with Tom Cruise, along with the series regular Ving Rhames (as Luther Stickell), for the next three movies in the series. Rebecca Ferguson joined the cast in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, remained on board for Fallout, and looks to be reprising her role as Ilsa Faust in both MI:7 and MI:8.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tom-cruise-mission-impossible-900x675.jpg><p>There is no doubt that the Mission: Impossible <a href=#>franchise</a> is Tom Cruise’s baby. He is well known for performing most of the crazy stunts on the big screen, prompting the production crew and insurance companies to freak out on a regular basis. But Cruise has always been known for being a complete hands-on actor as well as a producer. This is why his recent onset outburst was hailed by some while blasted by others.</p><p>Tom Cruise famously ripped into a few crew members on set for their apparent lack of COVID protocol safety. The leaked audio, which was eventually published by the British tabloid newspaper The Sun, has Cruise going virtually apoplectic on the crew saying in part via <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>, “They’re back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us. Because they believe in us and what we’re doing,” Cruise yells. “I’m on the phone with every fu*king studio at night, insurance companies, producers and they’re looking at us and using us to make their movies. We are creating thousands of jobs, you motherfu*kers. I don’t ever want to see it again. Ever!” But Cruise didn’t stop there. “No apologies. You can tell it to the people who are losing their fu*king homes because our industry is shut down. It’s not going to put food on their table or pay for their college education. That’s what I sleep with every night — the future of this fu*king industry! So I’m sorry, I’m beyond your apologies.” The entirety of the audio can be <a href=#>heard here</a> because there is most definitely more to it.</p><p>On one hand, it’s commendable that Tom Cruise is fighting for what he believes to be true. In fact, it is true. COVID has put Hollywood, along with thousands of other businesses, in a major bind and Cruise sees their movie production and how they handle their set’s safety protocols as leading the way in the return to making movies. For his part, Cruise has been a constant mask-wearer to set, as he has made sure everyone else was. He also, get this, Cruise paid close to $700,000 from his own bank account for an old cruise ship so the cast and crew could isolate on during filming. One source close to the production told <a href=#>The Sun</a>, “Tom has taken it upon himself, along with the health and safety department, to try to force the safety precautions, with a view to keeping the film running. He does daily rounds to make sure that everything is set up appropriately, that people are behaving and working as safely as they can. He is very proactive when it comes to safety.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/tom-cruise-simon-pegg-900x506.jpg><p>Whether the recently posted Simon Pegg picture with Tom Cruise is from the current set or a previous one, it doesn’t appear the two actors are having any issues of their own. For now, Mission: Impossible 7 is scheduled for a November 19, 2021 release but it has not yet been confirmed if the movie will be ready for that date. Mission: Impossible 8 is currently scheduled to be released the following year on November 4, 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2irmaK8r3nPnp6gZaSkum6v0a6grJ1dmMKlsMuipaBmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsimon-pegg-tom-cruise-cuddling-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fsimon-pegg-tom-cruise-cuddling-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fsimon-pegg-tom-cruise-cuddling-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fsimon-pegg-tom-cruise-cuddling-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsimon-pegg-tom-cruise-cuddling-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsimon-pegg-tom-cruise-cuddling-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-type-of-siding-is-most-energy-efficient.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-type-of-siding-is-most-energy-efficient.html>What type of siding is most energy-efficient?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-much-does-a-toyota-tundra-weigh.html>How much does a toyota tundra weigh</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./how-much-does-a-toyota-tundra-weigh.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
