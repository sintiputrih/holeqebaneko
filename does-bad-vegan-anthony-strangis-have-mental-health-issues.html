Continue reading this article to the end for more information.</strong></p><p>“Bad Vegan,” the newest Netflix scam artist series, is full of unexpected twists and turns.</p><p>Many people may wonder if Anthony Strangis has a mental health problem or where he and Sarma Melngailis went after being busted in a shady money plan.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bad-vegan-does-anthony-strangis-have-mental-health-issues-background></span>Bad Vegan: Does Anthony Strangis Have Mental Health Issues? Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There’s no way of knowing whether Anthony Strangis has a mental health problem or not. According to the documentary Strangis, who had a $350,000 bond, was unable to pay it and spent the best part of a year in prison.</p><p>Strangis had already admitted his guilt by the time he pleaded guilty and was punished.</p><p>Melngailis claimed that just as Strangis was leaving prison, she was returning to Riker’s to serve the remainder of her term of three and a half months.</p><p>However, “Bad Vegan” ultimately showed that Strangis is a free man who has moved on with his life.</p><p>Many of the people interviewed for the film were also wary about this reality.</p><p>Some former colleagues believe that ladies everywhere should be aware of his proclivities and should avoid giving him money, while others believe he is a public safety risk who should not be allowed to scam anybody else.</p><p>Even at the end of the series, a phone call between Melngailis and Strangis after she was freed from prison hinted that the two weren’t quite done with each other.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anthony-strangis-wikipedia-explored></span>Anthony Strangis Wikipedia Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anthony Strangis is not listed on the Wikipedia official page. His name, along with his criminal background, is listed on his wife’s Wikipedia page.</p><p>Anthony has a history of gambling and criminal activity. He also included his wife in a few of his robberies.&nbsp;He is a convicted conman who was born on September 10th, 1972.</p><p>He is the ex-husband of Pure Food and Wine creator Sarma Melngailis, as well as a convicted conman who pleaded guilty to grand larceny, a plot to defraud, and criminal tax fraud in 2017.</p><p>He spent over a year in prison on remand after being detained alongside Sarma in May of 2016.</p><p>Since being released from prison in May 2017, Anthony has kept a modest profile.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=anthony-strangis-wife-who-is-he-married-to></span>Anthony Strangis Wife: Who Is He Married To?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Anthony Strangis previously married Sarma Melngailis, who is now his ex-wife. After nearly six years of marriage, their divorce was finalized two months later in August 2018.</p><p>Sarma accused her ex-husband of assaulting her mentally, physically, and sexually throughout their relationship during their 2017 trial.</p><p>She also claims he encouraged her to bankrupt her thriving vegan business.</p><p>Sarma co-founded and co-owned the popular New York City restaurants Pure Food and Wine and One Lucky Duck.</p><p>Her company was forced to close in 2015 after getting numerous complaints.</p><p>Moving on, Sarma was charged with fraud in 2016 and was found guilty in 2017. Sarma and her husband, Anthony, were both arrested in Sevierville, Tennessee in 2016.</p><p>She pleaded guilty in 2017 to stealing over $200k and was sentenced to four months in prison. She divorced her husband Anthony later that year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyfmsBursCdZK%2Bdl5a7bq3NrZ%2BopqliwLW%2BwKeeoqtdna63sYymnKeskaF6qbHApauhZZmowLax0mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-bad-vegan-anthony-strangis-have-mental-health-issues.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdoes-bad-vegan-anthony-strangis-have-mental-health-issues.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdoes-bad-vegan-anthony-strangis-have-mental-health-issues.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdoes-bad-vegan-anthony-strangis-have-mental-health-issues.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-bad-vegan-anthony-strangis-have-mental-health-issues.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-bad-vegan-anthony-strangis-have-mental-health-issues.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lyrics-my-god-is-greater.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lyrics-my-god-is-greater.html>My god is greater lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cranberry-cookies.html>Cranberry Cookies</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cranberry-cookies.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
