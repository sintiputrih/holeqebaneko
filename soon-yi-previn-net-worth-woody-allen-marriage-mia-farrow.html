He said, “As far as marriage was concerned, neither of us had any great need to formalize our relationship. We both felt that no contract is worth the paper it’s printed on if the parties are not happy. We loved each other and there was no need to resort to legislature. We would definitely not wed, and that was that. And then we married. Why? Not for romantic reasons but strictly financial.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Woody Allen And Wife Soon-Yi Previn Are So Private About Their Kids</a></span></p><p>It's also likely that Woody Allen and Soon Yi Previn share a bank account or that they share finances somehow since they are married and Woody wrote about wanting to make sure that she would be okay. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Woody Allen has a $140 million net worth,</a> according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><p>Hollywood Life reported that the couple lives in the Upper West Side in New York City and that they have two daughters who they adopted.

The critic focused on the 1979 film Manhatten and wrote, “You get the feeling watching Woody Allen’s films that he’s trying to make us acclimated to the idea of these kinds of relationships, this sort of power dynamic — in a sense, grooming us. It’s something that he does repeatedly, over and over, in films. Throughout the years, the same archetypes show up. The same kinds of big age gaps in relationships show up. When you see it over and over, it kind of attunes you to thinking, this is normal.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Alec Baldwin And Woody Allen's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=woody-allen-and-soon-yi-previn-39-s-relationship>Woody Allen And Soon Yi Previn's Relationship</h2><p>In an interview with New York Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Soon Yi Previn talked about her childhood</a>, and she said that her adoptive mother Mia Farrow began dating Woody Allen when Soon Yi was ten years old.
