Scott Ruffalo was the brother of popular actor and film star, Mark Ruffalo.</h3><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p>Scott RuRuffalobffalo was born on <strong>1 February 1969</strong> in Kenosha, Wisconsin, USA. His parents are Lawrence Ruffalo Jr. (father) and Marie Rose (mother). His father worked as a construction painter and his mother is a hairdresser and stylist. Scott was the younger brother of Mark Ruffalo. Also, he has two sisters named Tania and Nicole.</p><p>Speaking of his educational qualification, he graduated from ‘First Colonial High School’ in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Later, he completed his diploma in hairdressing from the Los Angeles University before he earned a verified license in Cosmetology.</p><p>Moreover, Scott fell in love with styling and hairdressing from his mother at an early age and had always wanted to become a professional and own his own shop even when he was a teenager.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-133500 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Scott-Ruffalo-News.jpg alt="Scott Ruffalo" width=650 height=462 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-133500 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Scott Ruffalo and his brother, Mark’s picture. Source: News</p><h4>Death</h4><p>Scott was found with a gunshot wound at the back of his head on&nbsp;<b> </b>. Then, he died a week later after the medical team failed to save him. He was 39 at the time and the police confirmed that the incident had taken place at midnight.</p><p>As his death was initially ruled as a suicide, the coroner’s report proved that the angle of entry of the bullet meant that he could not have shot himself. Thus, the police said it was a homicide. Further, the key witness in his homicide case was a Saudi woman named Shaha Mishaal Adham.</p><p>Therefore, she claimed to have walked in time to see him shoot himself just after he mentioned something about “Russian roulette”. And, after 4 years of Scott’s case, she died in 2012 of a suspected drug overdose. And, since then, the investigation was never mentioned again in the news. Therefore, it remains unresolved to this day.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>Likely, Scott started practicing hairstyling in his mother’s salon at a young age. He earned a verified license in Cosmetology. Therefore, this license means that he studied beauty treatments, including hairstyling, skincare, cosmetics, manicures/pedicures, and permanent or non-permanent hair removal.</p><p>Similarly, he worked as a hairstylist in several salons in Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. Later, he also worked at Guiseppe Franco Salon. Franco Salon is an outlet that is patronized by some of the biggest celebrities in America. In the year 2001, he founded his own salon called Ruff Inc.</p><p>Also, he worked with several well-known celebrities. This hairstyling genius had built an impressive brand as well as become successful in his field, something he dreamed of as a child watching his own mother at work.</p><h2><span id=Personal_Life>Personal Life</span></h2><p>At the time of his death, Scott was married to <strong>Luzelena Ruffalo</strong>. And, he also had adopted her daughter from a previous relationship, Lucinda. But, he did not live with Luzelena and there were unconfirmed claims that he was living with another woman who was possibly his girlfriend.</p><p>In addition, he was also said to be a drug and alcohol addict per sources. Moreover, he had led him to have a confrontation with the law in April 2002. And, it was when he convicted of a felony charge for ownership of a controlled substance for sale.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-133498 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Scott-Ruffalo-Access.jpg alt="Scott Ruffalo" width=650 height=440 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-133498 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Scott Ruffalo’s picture with his wife and brother.
