In the "about us" section, Houska shares some beautiful and poetic words about the inspiration behind the company. She talks about how important family is to her and how she wanted to create a company with those values. She wrote, "I believe in big dreams. And I’ve always had a lot of them. For years, I’ve dreamed of building a happy, free-roaming flock of a family. Little ones, spaghetti-stained and giggling, sprinting from room to room."</p><p>She continued, "Family is our source of joy" and added, "But our home matters, too."</p><p class=p1>Houska&nbsp;explained, "We are setting out to make the kind of products that turn four white walls into cozy homes — for families of all kinds.
