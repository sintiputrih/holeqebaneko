<time>21 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>When news of <a href=#>Tiger Woods'</a> cheating scandal came to light, fans were baffled. He and Elin Nordegren had seemed like a picture-perfect couple, and the fact that they had many millions to spend on themselves and their two kids seemed like a bonus. But soon, Elin and Tiger would be tied up in court, hashing out the details of their settlement, though the public wouldn't know for many years just how it all ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elin Nordegren kept quiet after the divorce, but later, details began to slip about the terms of the settlement and how much money Tiger Woods' ex-wife may have walked away with. But it seemed that Tiger may not have kept up his end of the bargain in that settlement, and even broke a specific term of the deal.</p><h2 id=tiger-woods-gave-elin-nordegren-millions-of-dollars-in-their-divorce>Tiger Woods Gave Elin Nordegren Millions Of Dollars In Their Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar49167336.jpg><p>Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren's famous divorce settlement resulted in Tiger paying out many millions to his ex-wife. Thanks, in part, to her $100 million divorce settlement from Tiger, <a href=#>Elin Nordegren built up a net worth</a> that rivaled the famous golfer's (at least, for a while).</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Tiger Woods Gifted His Half-Sister A House, But She Once Said She'd Rather Live In A Shack</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The amount she ultimately received was impressive, but it was also rumored that <a href=#>Tiger offered Elin about $350 million (and a contract) to get back together</a>—and keep mum about his cheating scandal.</p><p>Clearly, Elin turned down the offer and instead went to court to earn about 20 percent of Tiger's worth, as well as some terms that were favorable to both her and the couple's children.</p><h2 id=elin-and-tiger-39-s-divorce-settlement-had-specific-requirements>Elin And Tiger's Divorce Settlement Had Specific Requirements</h2><p>During Elin and Tiger's divorce, many details were worked out regarding the custody of their kids, Sam and Charlie. Nordegren almost immediately purchased a house in her home country of Sweden after the news broke of Tiger's infidelity, and his career began a downward spiral.</p><p>Woods would later make up for lost promotional and brand opportunities, but at the time, many corporations backed out of supporting the golfer. In court, he didn't have very many wins, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Before Meeting Tiger Woods, Elin Nordegren's Life Was Completely Different</a></span></p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">settlement reportedly contained a clause</a> that stated Tiger could not bring his children, who were toddlers at the time, around a new woman unless he planned to marry her. While Elin had full custody, the settlement agreement clearly stipulated visitation for Tiger, though the details were not made public.</p><p>Tiger may not have had a choice about honoring the cash or custody parts of the settlement, but he didn't seem to adhere to that one stipulation about bringing a woman around his kids.</p><h2 id=tiger-woods-technically-violated-his-divorce-settlement>Tiger Woods Technically Violated His Divorce Settlement</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/did-elin-nordegren-know-erica-herman-before-she-started-dating-her-ex-husband-tiger-woods_.jpg><p>Fans might interpret that the clause about Tiger not bringing any potential girlfriends around his children may have alluded to the fact that he had many mistresses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that his cheating was what broke up the marriage, it's understandable that Elin would not have wanted her three-year-old and one-year-old around multiple strange women. Plus, divorce is often difficult for children at any age, and having their lives disrupted by their parents splitting up was probably enough of a change for little Sam and Charlie.</p><p>But years later, Tiger seemed to forget about the settlement stipulation, and his kids have since met most of his girlfriends post-divorce.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Much Erica Herman Is Worth (Without Tiger Woods)</a></span></p><p>When Tiger Woods was dating <a href=#>Lindsey Vonn, who mostly has good things to say about her ex today</a>, he introduced her to his children. Various photographs exist of Lindsey standing on the sidelines at Tiger's golf events where his kids are present, sitting with Sam and Charlie on the green, and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his next serious relationship, Tiger even moved his girlfriend into his home. Though Sam and Charlie are said to primarily live with their mother, in 2019, they also spent time at their father's home, which he shared with Erica Herman.</p><p>Fortunately for Tiger Woods, it didn't seem that Elin Nordegren had any problem with him breaking the settlement terms and introducing his various girlfriends to their kids over the years. In fact, it's said that Elin even supported Tiger and Erica's living arrangement.</p><h2 id=do-elin-and-tiger-get-along-today>Do Elin And Tiger Get Along Today?</h2><p>By all accounts, <a href=#>Elin Nordegren and Tiger Woods are on decent terms</a>, mostly due to wanting their kids to have a drama-free upbringing. Tiger called their relationship "fantastic," and though Elin doesn't say much and seems to prefer living a private life, she has revealed some details about their co-parenting relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In one interview, Elin admitted that while it was hard, and she went through the wringer, she somehow knew things would turn out okay on the family relationship front.</p><p>Even though Tiger has had various (and serious) relationships since their split, it doesn't seem as if those relationships came between Tiger and Elin—or Tiger and his children.</p><p>What's more, Tiger seems to want to keep his relationship drama, when it happens, under wraps. Fans can only assume he's insulating his kids against any drama, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirop%2BVp3q4u86dqmacmau8s6%2FEZqqerKShsq6xza1m</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftiger-woods-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftiger-woods-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftiger-woods-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftiger-woods-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftiger-woods-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftiger-woods-divorce-settlement.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tre-ward.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tre-ward.html>Tre Ward</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./230147-new-pics-torrie-wilson-in-her-underwear.html>NEW PICS: Torrie Wilson In Her Underwear!</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./230147-new-pics-torrie-wilson-in-her-underwear.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
