That's not to say there <a href=#>aren't instances where this has definitely happened</a>, but there are also others where the "victim" in question is clearly unhinged, like <a href=#>this one woman who told a blind guy to stop staring at her</a>.</p><p>But this one clip of gas station worker Sami Jean (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nobootyshakin</a>) isn't one of those clips: in the video, she records a customer who is either incapable of, or uncaring of non-verbal cues as he attempts to strike up a conversation with her. Sami, who is working alone at the gas station, is visibly uncomfortable throughout her discussion with the male patron.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@nobootyshakin href=#>@nobootyshakin</a><p>me printing the exact same paper over and over to appear busy <a title=creepyguy href=#>#creepyguy</a> <a title=redflags href=#>#redflags</a> <a title=awkwardlaugh href=#>#awkwardlaugh</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - Sami Jean" href=#>♬ original sound - Sami Jean</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @nobootyshakin</span></figure><p>She writes in a text overlay of the video: "POV: you work overnight at a gas station alone," and she adds in a caption that she repeatedly printed the exact same paper over and over again in an attempt to appear busy in the hopes that the man would leave her be.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nobootyshakin</span></figure><p>What transpires is a conversation between the two that is bizarre on its own, but becomes even more concerning when you consider that she's working alone, at night.</p><p>The man constantly looks over his shoulder back at his vehicle and talks about how law enforcement makes him nervous.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nobootyshakin</span></figure><p>He invites Sami out for a drive several times and after she finally says that she needs to return back to work, he asks her flat-out if she'd like to go to a hotel room with him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nobootyshakin</span></figure><p>When she declines and tells him that she has a boyfriend he continues to talk about how much police officers make him nervous and that he wishes the store wouldn't offer them free drinks and donuts so much so they wouldn't be around.</p><p>So while a lot of unsavory interactions between people could simply be chalked up to someone just being awkward, this doesn't seem like one of those cases.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @nobootyshakin</span></figure><p>Their talk goes as follows:</p><p>Customer: "I should've taken off my front plate"</p><p>Sami: "Your front plate?
