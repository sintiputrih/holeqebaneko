Looks like we have a girl power moment on our hands!</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><i>“</i>You’re Drunk Go Home” will come out on Sept. 23, but Carly has a lot to look forward to before then, too. In August, she returned to host the ACM Honors for the second year in a row. This year, though, the event will be televised on FOX on Sept. 13. Read more from our interview with Carly below, where she dished about that, the upcoming CMA Awards and more!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong>On returning to host ACM Honors:&nbsp;</strong>Oh my gosh, I was so excited when they asked me. I love getting to host. That’s something that’s super important to me as I continue to build my career. So to get to do it for a second year was so great. It went from obviously being a very special night the first year, but it was all live streamed and still during the pandemic times. So to get to do it now and have it be my first big hosting situation on my own, on a major network…I felt the pressure. But I was excited.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8><strong>On what to look forward to during the ACM Honors:</strong> I’m not just saying this to blow smoke, but every single performance of the night [was incredible]. It’s such an interesting show where other artists take on and do their own interpretations of honorees’ music. Kelsea Ballerini did an amazing, theatrical performance of “Man I Feel Like A Woman.’&nbsp;<strong>Brooks & Dunn</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Little Big Town</strong> honored&nbsp;<strong>Miranda Lambert</strong> in ways that were really special.&nbsp;<strong>Vince Gill&nbsp;</strong>honored&nbsp;<strong>Chris Stapleton</strong>. It was such a fun night. Every performance was so unique.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>On the success of her latest single “What He Didn’t Do”:&nbsp;</strong>This song, for me, ahs been one that I feel like fans have gravitated towards ever since I released it by just singing it in a little writer’s round in Nashville during the pandemic. I sang it and it went viral immediately. Someone’s cellphone video was put up online and it’s been the little song that I feel like fans have wanted the whole time. For me, it’s one of the songs I really fought for wanting it to be a single at some point. It’s honestly bigger than any song I’ve had as far as natural growth on socials and streaming and in my live shows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Carly-Pearce-Kelsea-Ballerini-Kelly-Clarkson-New-Song-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-10>I think what’s so cool about it is that it came from such a dark place for me and has become such an anthem of not lowering your expectations and making sure that in a relationship your expectations are met and you do feel loved because you deserve that.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>On new music she’s working on:</strong> I’m working on new music and I’m really excited for fans to get to hear it. I think that it has been such a transitional time for me. In no way am I saying, ‘Oops, I’m happy and everything’s great!’ in the new music, but I do think people will see the evolution of me finding happiness and coming out on the other side and how I’m wrestling with all those different emotions that come with opening your heart again.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>On her 5 CMA Awards nominations, including Female Vocalist of the Year, which she won in 2021:&nbsp;</strong>They all surprise me, every single time. It surprised me that I had five, for sure. As a songwriter, at the ACMs in 2021, when I won for Single of the Year, I remember being like…that’s so cool. And to now be nominated at the CMAs for Single and Song of the Year on a song that was such a personal experience is just the most rewarding thing as a songwriter. Those are always the ones where it’s just like…wow, that’s really awesome. But also really excited about Female Vocalist, too!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BrZpyZoqHGbrzEmqmcnV2gsq242GaapZmioMCwuoyknKWrlZZ6o63LpZyroZ6eerS7zaBkmpudYrWwus6rqmahnqmys8LInq5o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcarly-pearce-kelly-clarkson-kelsea-ballerini-song-acm-honors-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcarly-pearce-kelly-clarkson-kelsea-ballerini-song-acm-honors-interview.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcarly-pearce-kelly-clarkson-kelsea-ballerini-song-acm-honors-interview.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcarly-pearce-kelly-clarkson-kelsea-ballerini-song-acm-honors-interview.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcarly-pearce-kelly-clarkson-kelsea-ballerini-song-acm-honors-interview.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcarly-pearce-kelly-clarkson-kelsea-ballerini-song-acm-honors-interview.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./labor-unions-history.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./labor-unions-history.html>Labor Unions In America And Photos Of The Bloody Battle For Fair Working Conditions</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kardashians-halloween-costumes-through-the-years-20152610.html>Kardashians' Best Halloween Costumes | Us Weekly</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kardashians-halloween-costumes-through-the-years-20152610.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
