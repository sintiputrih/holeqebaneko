<time>07 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Astronomers calculation nyt is a crossword clue that appeared in the New York Times Mini Crossword puzzle on April 8, 2023. The clue was “Astronomer’s calculation, in slangy shorthand” and the answer was “obvi”. In this article, we will explain the meaning and origin of the clue and the answer, as well as some facts about the crossword puzzle and its creator.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Clue and the Answer</h3><p>The clue “Astronomer’s calculation, in slangy shorthand” is a clever wordplay that combines two meanings of the word “calculation”. One meaning is a mathematical or scientific operation that involves numbers or formulas, such as what an astronomer would do to measure the distance or movement of celestial bodies. The other meaning is a deliberate or cunning plan or action, such as what a schemer would do to achieve their goals or deceive others.</p><p>The answer “obvi” is a slang term that is short for “obviously”. It is used to express obviousness, sarcasm, or annoyance. It is often used as a response to a statement or question that is considered stupid, naive, or redundant. For example:</p><ul><li>A: Did you know that the sun is a star?</li><li>B: Obvi, everyone knows that.</li><li>A: Do you like chocolate?</li><li>B: Obvi, who doesn’t like chocolate?</li><li>A: I think you should study for the test tomorrow.</li><li>B: Obvi, that’s what I’m doing right now.</li></ul><p>The clue and the answer are related because they both use abbreviations or acronyms to save space and time. The clue uses “NYT” to refer to the New York Times, which is a well-known newspaper and crossword publisher. The answer uses “obvi” to refer to “obviously”, which is a common word in everyday speech and writing.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>The Crossword Puzzle and Its Creator</h3><p>The New York Times Mini Crossword is a shorter version of the classic New York Times Crossword puzzle that can be played online or on a mobile app. It was first introduced in 2014 as a daily online puzzle and has since become a popular feature for solvers looking for a quick and fun crossword challenge.

The clues are usually easy to moderate in difficulty and cover various topics such as pop culture, sports, science, history, geography, and more.</p><p>The creator of the New York Times Mini Crossword is Joel Fagliano, who is also the digital puzzles editor for the New York Times. He started making crosswords when he was 15 years old and became the youngest person ever to have a puzzle published in the New York Times when he was 17 years old. He graduated from Princeton University in 2014 with a degree in music composition. He has also created puzzles for other publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, and BuzzFeed.</p><p>Fagliano is known for his clever and witty clues and his innovative and diverse themes.

He also tries to keep his puzzles fresh and relevant by incorporating current events, trends, slang, celebrities, and more.</p><p>Fagliano has received numerous awards and recognition for his work, such as the Orca Award for Best Mini Crossword in 2016, the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament Rookie Award in 2012, and the Princeton University Music Department Certificate of Excellence in 2014.</p><p>Astronomers calculation nyt is a crossword clue that tests the solver’s knowledge of astronomy, slang, and abbreviations.
