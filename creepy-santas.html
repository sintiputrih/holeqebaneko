<time>02 Apr 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2 class=dek>Each year, malls across America set up displays for children to take their picture with "Santa" — but sometimes these mall Santas are a far cry from jolly old St. Nick.</h2><p class=dropcaps>We have a weird tradition in America of taking children to the mall, letting them sit on a stranger’s lap, and paying money to have a photo taken of the moment. Of course, the stranger in question is Santa Claus — but not the real Santa. No, instead, children are taken to see creepy mall Santas.</p><p>That’s not to say every mall Santa is creepy or, inversely, that every creepy old man works as Santa at a mall.</p><p>In fact, the very first mall Santa — who was actually a department store Santa —&nbsp;put the red suit on because he wanted to spread Christmas cheer to all of the children who came into his store.</p><p>But that was back in 1890, and in the nearly century-and-a-half since then, the idea of Santa has become highly commodified.</p><p>Nearly every mall in America has a photo booth with a Santa and a long line of anxious children waiting to tell him what they want for Christmas. Fortunately for the malls, what the children want often happens to be up an escalator and to the left.</p><p>And because there are so many malls across the U.S., the job is sometimes given to people who might not be up to the task. Still, photos must be taken, and thankfully some of those captured moments feature laughably bizarre-looking Santas that now live on forever on the internet.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “Christmas 1985. Every time I see this photo, I wonder how on Earth I sat there calmly? I mean, look at the dude on the left.”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “Me and my twin sister getting traumatized in Middlesbrough, 1981 by Santa and his devil doll clowns.”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>Santa is giving some serious side-eye here, but the hand-in-the-shape-of-a-claw really solidifies the threatening nature. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: "Santa smelled like cigarettes, B.O. and whiskey. My sister was NOT into it, and I was super excited that she was throwing a fit."</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>We can't expect Santa's makeup to look perfect every day, but this is some truly horrendous work. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Perhaps the only thing worse than a grown man in a Santa suit is a terrifying doll in a Santa suit. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>It is not 100 percent clear whether this is an old photo of a woman standing next to someone dressed as Santa Claus, or if she has accidentally summoned a demon. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “Mom, there’s a reason there wasn’t a line to see this Santa…"</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>A good rule of thumb for any Santa is to not look like you've just actively engaged in a drunken pub brawl. Or, at the very least, smile for the photo.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “My little girl in 2012 with a very sauced looking Santa.”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>There is absolutely nothing jolly about this Santa. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Half of Santa's lasting charm is that he brings children presents on Christmas. The other half is that he's a jolly, old, bearded man with a twinkle in his eye, which is conspicuously absent in this absolute monstrosity of a mask. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Christmastime, 1912. Santa was apparently much more Slenderman-like before the 1940s.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “I don’t remember having this photo taken, but every time I look at it as an adult, I am horrified that I was planted on Santa’s lap. He couldn’t look any less excited about his job... I’m looking a little uncertain about the whole thing as well! Bet there wasn’t a 'ho, ho, ho' greeting involved here!”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>December 1963, Garden Grove, California. </span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “In Yugoslavia, we had very scary Santas in the 1980s.”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>There's nothing inherently creepy about anything Santa is doing, he's just unsettlingly ecstatic.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “Me and the creepiest Santa ever. 1977."</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>There is a feeling of murderous rage to Santa's smile here.</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “The memories around this pic are fuzzy, I suspect that I have blocked out Santa trying to lift my shirt and/or pinch my nipple. If I had to guess, I was probably around four years old (1979). Clearly, I am horrified by the look on my face.”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>Another good rule for Santas is to try your best not to look as if you're about to abduct a child. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>There are a few things wrong here, but chiefly is that it's difficult to tell if this man is supposed to be Santa, or if he was just an old man who happened to be passing by. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Santa masks. No. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “This is me in 1970 when I was 5 and meeting a Santa who had face-boobs.”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>Santa Claus showing off his Santa claws. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “Posing with (a creepy, lol) Santa Claus and reindeer at Kresge's Department Store in Lafayette, Indiana, USA - 1947”</span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>As far as Santas go, this one at least looks the part. The problem is that Santa really shouldn't be laughing maniacally as a child cries on his lap. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: "This photo was taken in 1972 when I was almost 2. Not sure why I was scared but looking at the picture 40 years later, the deadly grip Santa had on me..."</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>As a tradition, visiting Santa at the mall is a bit strange. As a marketing tool, it's genius. As a child, it's traumatizing. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Either a very angry Santa or a man photographed in a moment of panic as he tries to catch a falling child while maintaining his photo smile. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “We dug this gem up recently. None of us realized how creepy the Santa was except our baby sister. We still aren’t sure where the camera actually was.”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>Well, someone made the naughty list. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “My memories of meeting Santa are fond ones. I came across this pic, however, and was startled by the look on this particular Santa’s face. He looks a little less interested in what I want for Christmas, and a little more interested in how I’d taste in a stew.”</span><span class=credit>Awkward Family Photos</span> <span class=caption-body>It could be the beard that doesn't quite cover the face, the hunched over posture, or the lack of any attempt at smiling or looking at the camera —&nbsp;but something about this Santa screams hangover. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Santa Claus is, technically, a home invader. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>If eyes are the windows to the soul, then this Santa has no soul.</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “Me and my sister, Christmas in Chile 1996.

It's the velvet chair she hates. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Santa is allegedly immortal, but he does evidently age. </span><span class=credit>Facebook</span> <span class=caption-body>Original Caption: “That’s me in the lap of a suburban D.C. mall Santa circa Christmas, 1976 when I was 4.

On more than one occasion, he dressed himself as a clown to entertain the children.</p><p>Then, one day, it occurred to him that "[Santa] is so far away... only able to see the children one day a year. He should live closer to them."</p><p>Inspired by images that he saw in editions of Harper's Weekly, Edgar ordered a custom-tailored Santa suit and traveled via train to Boston in order to pick it up.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-406387 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/harpers-weekly-christmas-illustration.jpg alt="Harper's Weekly Christmas Illustration" width=900 height=642 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-406387 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>New-York Historical Society</span><span class=caption-body>Harper's Weekly, December 29, 1865.</span></p><p>When he returned and donned the suit, his customers were elated.</p><p>One customer later recalled the experience fondly, saying, "I remember walking down an aisle, and all of a sudden, right in front of me, I saw Santa Claus. I couldn't believe my eyes. And then Santa came up and started talking to me. It was a dream come true."</p><p>Edgar's Santa getup was such a hit, in fact, that children began traveling to his little store from New York, Boston, Providence, and Worcester to see the jolly old man.</p><p>The next year, several major department stores had their own Santas — and this pretty much became the expectation by 1900.</p><p>However, taking your photo with Santa didn't really kick off for another few decades.</p><h2>Santa Sells: How A Beloved Christmas Icon Became A Commercial Asset</h2><p>As writer Eliza Thompson reports in an article with <a href=# rel=noopener>Shutterstock</a>, the trend of getting a souvenir photo with Santa Claus well and truly began in 1943 when a Seattle Post-Intelligencer photographer named Arthur French noticed a line of children outside a nearby Frederick & Nelson department store.</p><p>The next year, he took some time off from the paper and set up a small shop inside the department store, snapping candid photos of children with Santa and selling them to the kids' parents.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-406435 alt="R.H.

While we now associate Mr. Claus with a big belly, rosy cheeks, and a twinkle in his eye, prior to 1931, Santa ran the gamut from bald priest to pipe-smoking, portly old man.</p><p>What changed in 1931? Well, as it turns out, that was the first year that the Coca-Cola company featured Santa Claus in an advertisement. The ad was so popular and successful that it helped solidify the classic Santa appearance we still know today.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-406855 alt="Coca Cola Santa Claus" width=709 height=811 data-sizes="(max-width: 709px) 100vw, 709px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/coca-cola-santa-claus.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-406855 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Coca-Cola</span><span class=caption-body>In 1931, Coca-Cola hired artist Haddon Sundblom to design advertisements featuring Santa taking inspiration from Clement Clark Moore's 1822 poem "A Visit From St. Nicholas."</span></p><p>Then, in 1947, the film A Miracle on 34th Street released, and mall Santas were cemented as a permanent piece of cultural lore.
