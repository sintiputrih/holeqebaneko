She excited about the future, but also a little scared.&nbsp;What would happen next? No one knew the answer to that question, but it probably couldn’t be any worse than what Arya had already been through. (Rest in peace, Ned, Catelyn and Robb.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>As her boat sailed through the city, Arya watched the town carry on with their day. How normal Braavos seemed. Normal was something Arya hadn’t been accustomed to for a&nbsp;long time. Arya had her eye on the prize — the House of Black and White — and it was now in plain sight. She knocked on the door of the House. When a man answered, Arya said “Valar morghulis” and presented him with the iron coin that Jaqen H’qhar had given her. The man&nbsp;refused to let her enter, even after Arya pleaded with him. “Please, I have nowhere else to go,” she said. “You have&nbsp;everywhere else to go,” he said before closing the door.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Shocked and clearly a little afraid, Arya decided to sit on the steps of the House. The sun set, and there Arya sat. “Cersei, Walder Frey, the Mountain, Meryn Trant,” Arya repeated to herself as she braved the darkness and rain. That’s quite a revenge agenda you’ve got there, A. Arya waited all night. When the sun rose, she threw the iron coin in the water and walked away.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Podrick and Brienne&nbsp;stopped for food on their journey and hit the jackpot. Podrick noticed Sansa and Littlefinger eating in the far corner. Sansa was lowkey flirting/teasing&nbsp;Littlefinger with her questions about courage. Brienne interrupted their little discussion to tell Sansa of her oath to Catelyn. Brienne promised to protect her no matter what. Littlefinger was not here for Brienne. He slayed Brienne with her past. She had failed to protect Renly, and she had failed to protect Catelyn. Once Sansa heard all this, she didn’t want anything to do with Brienne.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Brienne didn’t leave quietly, though. She caused quite a scene as she and Podrick rode away quickly on horses. Littlefinger’s men chased after them, and Podrick eventually got separated from Brienne. Seriously?! Can’t you do anything right, Podrick? He ended up horseless, and Brienne fought off the knights to protect him. If you need a graphic description, she stuck her sword through a guy’s&nbsp;neck.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Despite the hiccup, Brienne wasn’t giving up on Sansa or Arya. Even though Podrick brought up the fact that she could likely be relieved from her oath since they refused her service. But, nope. Brienne was ready to hit the road and stalk Sansa and Littlefinger. She’s a boss.</p><h3>‘Game Of Thrones’ Recap: Jaime’s New Mission</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>Over in King’s Landing, Cersei summoned Jaime. She had received a gift — more like a threat — from Dorne directed at Myrcella. Cersei would burn Dorne to the ground if they touched her daughter. She put the massive guilt trip on Jaime concerning fatherly duties. It didn’t take much convincing. Jaime soon announced he would go to Dorne to bring Myrcella back. Honestly, he’s probably just going there to get away from Cersei.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jaime needed a partner in crime for his Dorne mission, and he chose none other than Ser Bronn. The bromance of my dreams! If Bronn agreed to go, Jaime would reward him with a bigger castle and better bride.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In Dorne, Ellaria was complaining to Doran about the lack of response from him after Oberyn’s brutal death. She had the Sand Snakes (!), and they were going to avenge their father’s death at all costs. I’m. So. Ready.&nbsp;She had her eye on Myrcella. She wanted to send her back to Cersei one finger at a time. Doran refused to meet Ellaria’s demands for vengeance.</p><h3>‘Game Of Thrones’ Recap: Daenerys’ Trial Of Conviction</h3><p id=content-paragraph-11>Daario and Greyform searched Meereen for Son of the Harpy behind last week’s murder of one of the Unsullied. Daario, being a badass at his job, found a man hiding with that infamous gold mask hiding inside a wall. Daenerys had to decide what to do next with&nbsp;the Sons of the Harpy guy.&nbsp;After some convincing, she decided on a fair trial.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Tyrion and Varys were traveling to Meereen together. Tyrion was still drinkng, as expected. They weren’t just heading to Meereen, Varys revealed they were going to Volantis, too. There was a “ruler” there that Varys needed to see.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Since they were the only two in the room, Varys took the time to boost Tyrion’s confidence a bit. “You were quite good — at ruling — during your brief tenure as Hand,” Varys said. Tyrion didn’t deny the compliment and even said he liked having such power, even though Shae begged him to leave King’s Landing with her.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>At this point, the only way for people like Varys and Tyrion to have power was to align themselves with larger than life leaders. They needed to find this leader (a.k.a. Daenerys) before Cersei got Tyrion’s head severed. She was killing all of the dwarves in her attempt to hunt down Tyrion. Girl needs to&nbsp;chill.</p><h3>‘Game Of Thrones’ Recap: Born Again</h3><p id=content-paragraph-15>Cersei was basically acting like the Hand of the King, handing out titles to shut up the small council. As formidable as Cersei seemed, Kevan did not care one bit. He&nbsp;believed Tommen should be with the council to learn how to rule. Boy, he’s having too much fun flirting with Margaery. Kevan wasn’t going to live under Cersei’s bitchdom and headed back to Casterly Rock.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Over at the Wall, Stannis had summoned Jon Snow to discuss their next plan of action. Stannis wanted the free folk to follow him, but Jon thought that was too much to ask of them. Alister Thorne was about be elected the next Lord Commander, and he was going to make Jon’s life a living hell for his bravery. Stannis was willing to strike a deal so that he could have the North. If Jon Snow kneeled before him, he would rise as Jon Stark. I’ll never forget the look on Jon’s face in that moment. Ever.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Jon and Sam discussed this turn of events. Being relieved of his bastard title was the “first thing I ever remember wanting.” Despite legitimacy being within his grasp now, Jon confessed that he was going to refuse Stannis’ offer. He didn’t want to go back on his word to the Night’s Watch. Yada yada yada. Come on, live a little!</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>At the election, Alister and Denys made their case for Commander, but before the voting began, Sam had something to say! He went through of history of Jon’s most heroic acts. “He’s the commander we turned to when the night was darkest,” Sam said.&nbsp;Not going to lie, just shed a few tears right then. The votes were cast, and Jon and Alister were tied. But fear not! Maester Aemon cast his vote in favor of Jon Snow.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>And with that, Jon Snow was now the new Lord Commander!</p><h3>‘Game Of Thrones’ Recap: Fear Mhysa</h3><p id=content-paragraph-20>Arya was making her way around Braavos just fine. Fortunately for her, the man from the House of Black and White had followed her into the city. She, in turn, followed him back to the House. After returning the coin she had tossed away, he revealed himself as Jaqen H’ghar. However, he said he wasn’t Jaqen, he was “no one.” As he led her inside, he uttered, “And that is who a girl must become.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Despite Daenerys agreeing to a trial for the Sons of the Harpy member, the entire situation took a turn for the worse. The slave found a way into his cell and killed the Sons of the Harpy dude. He left his body out in the open as a warning. Daenerys didn’t like that. The slave claimed he killed the man for his “Mhysa,” but Daenerys could have this type of behavior happening now.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Daenerys gathered the people Meereen to announce that the slave’s punishment for the murder was death. The slave pleaded with Daenerys for his life, but to no avail. Daaris chopped off his head. Crazy riots ensued, but Daenerys was whisked away.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>Later, Daenerys wanted to wallow in her misery all by herself. But she wasn’t alone — Drogon was on the roof! Oh, what a glorious moment! She tried to touch him, but he flew away. I imagine Daenerys is saying “come back” to Drogon in her best Rose DeWitt Bukater&nbsp;voice right now.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of tonight’s Game of Thrones?
