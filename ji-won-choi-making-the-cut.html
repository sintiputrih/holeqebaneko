One of our early favorites is contestant <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ji Won Choi</a>, whose immigrant backstory inspired her career path.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">'Making the Cut' star Ji Won Choi moved from South Korea to Oklahoma when she was 10.</h2><p>The artist and her family emigrated to the U.S. from Seoul more than 15 years ago, and settled in a suburb of Oklahoma City. "I remember in my elementary school I was, like, the only girl who wasn't white, and I just grew up feeling really different and just feeling like I didn't belong," Choi shared in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Oklahoman</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"All I wanted to do was go out into the world," she explained. "I think growing up, it seemed so much like a bubble and I just wanted to be different and start embracing the different."</p><p>Choi felt the only way she could truly express herself was through fashion. "I would go to high school dressed in heels and, like, a whole outfit, and everyone at school was like, 'What are you doing?'" she recalled. "It was the way I kind of differentiated myself, and I just wanted to take it a step further."</p><p>At 18, she moved to New York to attend Parsons School of Design, which led to opportunities in Paris and Milan. "I took a gap year to just see the world and experience different places and cultures," she said. "I think what I love most about design is that it has the ability to bring different parts of the world together."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The streetwear designer collaborated with Adidas in 2019.</h2><p>A few months before filming Making the Cut, Choi debuted her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">collection with Adidas</a>, which has been worn by celebrities like Beyoncé and Kendall Jenner. "I wanted to bring in both [Korean and American] cultures and mix them together and make it feel like a new modernized version," she said of her aesthetic.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Adidas has been super, super supportive of my vision. I think the interconnectivity of cultures is something that people are interested in right now just because we are such a global world right now," she added. "I think it's what the fashion industry is moving towards, so I've had a lot of great response to my brand."</p><p>Despite being a Fashion Week veteran — Choi has had shows in both New York and London — the 26-year-old still learned a lot from her reality TV stint. "The point of the show was to create... for the runaway and something that is more accessible," she stated.&nbsp;</p><p>"A look that I want to make is something crazy and artful almost and something that's more sculptural… But fashion still is a business and it still has to be worn by people day to day," she acknowledged. "So, I think learning the balance of that was really good for me."</p><p>Making the Cut will drop two new episodes every Friday, ending with the Season 1 finale on April 24.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7Zuw86nZJygn556rq3KoqWgZaSdsm6v1K0%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fji-won-choi-making-the-cut.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fji-won-choi-making-the-cut.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fji-won-choi-making-the-cut.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fji-won-choi-making-the-cut.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fji-won-choi-making-the-cut.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fji-won-choi-making-the-cut.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./chelsea-hobbs-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./chelsea-hobbs-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html>Chelsea Hobbs Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./whatever-happened-to-froggy-fresh-html.html>Whatever Happened to Froggy Fresh?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./whatever-happened-to-froggy-fresh-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
