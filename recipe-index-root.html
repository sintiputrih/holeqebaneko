And they’re crispy too! Paired with a tasty dipping sauce, these baked sweet potato fries are impossible to resist. This sweet potato fries recipe is an updated version of a baked sweet potato fries recipe I shared several years ago. What’s changed? Well, if you’ve ever made sweet potato fries in the oven, you might know that it’s hard to get them crispy. I thought I’d tried every trick in the book—soaking them in cold…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This chipotle sauce will punch up any meal! It’s smoky, creamy, tangy, and easy to make with simple ingredients. I started making the recipe to put on the cauliflower tacos in my first cookbook, and now I love it on everything from burrito bowls to breakfast tacos to hearty salads. If you try it, I think you’ll fall for it too! I say this all the time, but I truly believe that the key to a great veggie meal (or any meal, really) is a great sauce.

We’re talking really simple—this flavorful Italian soup was originally a way to stretch leftovers. It was made by reheating bean and vegetable soup and adding day-old bread to thicken it. In fact, ribollita means “reboiled.” My ribollita recipe doesn’t start with leftovers. But in the Italian tradition, it does deliver rich flavor with basic ingredients. I begin by sautéing onion, carrot, and celery in a generous glug of olive oil. Then, I add garlic, fresh rosemary, and a splash of white wine. When the…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This air fryer vegetables recipe shows off everything I love about air frying. First, it’s quick and easy. These air fryer veggies cook in half the time it takes to make roasted vegetables in the oven! Second, it’s delicious.&nbsp;The air fryer vegetables are perfectly tender, with crisp, caramelized edges. Bonus: garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice add tons of great flavor. If you have an air fryer (this Instant Omni Plus is my favorite), these air fryer vegetables should definitely be in your rotation. They’re so simple to make, and they’re healthy and flavorful.

The egg bites keep well in the fridge for a couple of days (and longer in the freezer), so they’re great for meal prep. Plus, they’re packed with protein and flavorful veggies for an energizing start to the morning. The recipe is loosely inspired by the famous bacon and Gruyère Starbucks egg bites. They’re known for their velvety texture, which Starbucks says comes from cooking them using the French sous vide technique. I’m not about to get out a sous vide machine to cook breakfast, so I had to find another…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>This chana masala recipe is about to become the star of your weeknight dinner rotation. It calls for pantry ingredients. It cooks in one pot.

About Chana Masala Chana masala is a chickpea curry. Its name translates literally to spiced chickpeas, “chana” meaning chickpeas and “masala” meaning spice.

Move over, soggy lettuce and watery tomatoes—this shaved fennel salad is crisp, refreshing, and bright, just the thing to balance a hearty pasta or other comforting meal. Fresh fennel is one of the most underrated vegetables…and it also happens to be one of my favorites. It has a really lovely anise flavor and, when it’s raw, a great crunchy texture. If you’re on the fence about fennel, or if you’ve never tried it before, I hope you’ll make this recipe.

Sure, it’s simple. But that doesn’t mean it’s bland or boring. This lentil soup is packed with hearty greens, tender vegetables, and fiber- and protein-rich lentils.
