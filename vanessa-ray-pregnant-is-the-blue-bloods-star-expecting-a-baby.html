They hit it off and started a long-distance relationship, as Vanessa was based in Los Angeles and Landon was in New York. They eventually moved in together and got engaged in 2015.</p><p>Vanessa Ray and Landon Beard had a rustic wedding at the Condor’s Nest Ranch in California, surrounded by their family and friends. The bride wore a vintage-inspired gown by Shareen Bridal, while the groom wore a blue suit by J.Crew.
