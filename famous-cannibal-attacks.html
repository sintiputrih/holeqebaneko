In 1981, Sagawa invited one of his Paris classmates over for a study session. When she arrived, he murdered and cannibalized her over the course of two days. Thanks to poor relations between his homeland of Japan and France, where he’d been studying, Sagawa was released from prison upon his deportation, and lives today as a free man.</span><span class=credit>Corbis Historical/Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Vince Li</h2><img alt="Vince Li Famous Cannibals" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vince.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>Tim McClean was riding on a Greyhound bus in 2008, minding his own business when he was stabbed, beheaded and cannibalized in full view of the other passengers. The man behind the crime, <a href=# rel=noopener>Vince Li</a>, was found not criminally responsible for the gruesome and highly public crime, and was remanded to a mental health facility. He was released in 2017.</span><span class=credit>New York Daily News</span><h2 class=title>Armin Meiwes</h2><img alt="Armin Meiwes Famous Cannibals" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/armin.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><a href=# rel=noopener>Armin Meiwes</a> placed an ad online in a cannibal chat room, requesting someone willing to be eaten. Shockingly, he received a reply, from a man named Bernd Brandes. In 2001, the pair met up, and Bernd willingly submitted to Miewes request. After killing him in his bathtub, Armin Meiwes spent 10 months consuming 44 pounds of Bernd before he was arrested. Since beginning his life sentence, he has converted to vegetarianism.</span><span class=credit>Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Nikolai Dzhumagaliev</h2><img alt="Nikolai Dzhumagaliev Famous Cannibals" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/metal-fang-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body><a href=# rel=noopener>Nikolai Dzhumagaliev</a> was a creative cannibal.

Police shot 31-year-old Rudy Eugene, after he refused to stop gnawing on the face of a 65-year-old man in the middle of a busy highway. According to witnesses, all that was left of the victim’s face after police intervened was his beard.</span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><h2 class=title>Katherine Knight</h2><img alt="Katherine Knight" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/katherine-knight-stew.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=caption-body>In 2000, housewife <a href=# rel=noopener>Katherine Knight</a> stabbed her husband John. Then, she hung his body from a hook in their living room, skinned him, decapitated him, and cooked parts of his body in a dish with potato, pumpkin, beets, zucchini and cabbage. Then, she put out two servings of John for his children when they got home. Thankfully, police arrived before they consumed their father, though his head was found still stewing in a pot of vegetables on the stove. She became the first woman to be sentenced to life in prison in Australia.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Michael Rockefeller</h2><img alt="Michael Rockefeller And Tribe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/rockefller-tribe.jpg> <span class=caption-body>In 1961, the youngest son of former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, <a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Rockefeller</a>, went missing while traveling through Netherland New Guinea. He was last seen when his trading canoe capsized as he was rowing through a part of the country known as the "cannibal coast."

During an expedition to the Congo, he requested to witness cannibalism firsthand. The team's solution: to purchase him a 10-year-old girl and watch her be cannibalized in front of him. Jameson wrote about the ordeal in his diary, accompanying them with sketches.</span><span class=credit>Getty Images</span><h2 class=title>Antron "Big Lurch" Singleton</h2><img alt="Big Lurch" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/big-lurch-blood.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Antron Singleton, better known by his rapper name <a href=# rel=noopener>Big Lurch</a>, made headlines in 2002, but not because of his music. While high on PCP, he had attacked his girlfriend Alisa Allen. After stabbing her repeatedly in the chest, he cut open her chest cavity, pulled out her lung, and began eating it. He was found guilty of murder, and now lectures on the dangers of PCP.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Klára Mauerová</h2><img alt="Klára Mauerová" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/worst-mother.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Klára Mauerová may take the prize for worst mother ever. When her sons were young boys, aged 10 and 14, she brought them into a cult that practiced cannibalism. Worse, though, than forcing them to engage in the cults practices was what she subjected them to at home. She put them through torture, sexual assault, regular beatings, and meals comprised of their own flesh, cut from their still alive bodies.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Rick Gibson</h2><img alt="Rick Gibson Cannibal Art" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/tonsil-canape.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Perhaps the most shocking act of cannibalism on this list is that of Rick Gibson. In 1988 and again in 1989, Gibson ate human flesh in public in London. England has no law against cannibalism (which Gibson described as “marvellous”) meaning his public meals of human-tonsil-canape and human-testicle-hors d'oeuvre were perfectly legal.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Omaima Nelson</h2><img alt="Omaima Nelson" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/omaima-nelson.jpg> <span class=caption-body><a href=# rel=noopener>Omaima Nelson</a> is a former model who killed her abusive husband of one month and cannibalized him on Thanksgiving day.

To make matters worse, they had chopped up the man after his murder, and sold his meat to a local kabob salesman. Even worse than that, was the fact that no one could pinpoint when the sale had occurred – or if any bits of the man had been sold.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>SS Dumaru</h2><img alt="SS Dumaru" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Untitled-1-1.jpg> <span class=caption-body>The crew of the SS Dumaru were forced into cannibalism due to their dire circumstances.

In addition to a crossbow, he was also known to use a samurai sword on his victims, most notably his final victim, a prostitute who he murdered in a hotel hallway in full view of the CCTV. Afterward he waved his crossbow at the camera, retreated to his room, and ate his victim.</span><span class=credit>YouTube</span><h2 class=title>Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571</h2><img alt="Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 Crash Site" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ugandan-crash-site.jpg> <span class=caption-body>Sometimes acts of cannibalism aren’t intentional. The passengers of <a href=# rel=noopener>Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571</a> discovered that when they found themselves stranded on an Andes mountain top after their plane crashed.

The next morning, the owner of the B&B awoke to a horrible sight. Williams was in his room, covered in blood, eating the body of a woman who had arrived in the middle of the night.
