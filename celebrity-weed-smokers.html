<time>01 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The use of cannabis has been around for centuries, and it is no surprise that celebrities partake in smoking or ingesting marijuana and other drugs. For many stars, there’s a certain allure associated with the lifestyle that comes with being high on weed. They often see it as a way to escape their overwhelming celebrity responsibilities — like interviews, photoshoots, performances, and so forth.</p><p>Celebrity culture can also be quite competitive when it comes to who’s “cooler” between different stars. <a href=# data-type=post data-id=9598>Smoking weed</a> might be seen as an act of rebellion and trying something new among fellow actors or musicians. Many people look up to celebrities — if they’re doing it, others will follow suit in order to fit in.</p><p>Though marijuana use carries some risks and is <a href=# rel=noopener>illegal in many places</a>, celebrities often have access to high-quality strains with incredibly low THC levels. This means that they can get the desired effects without worrying about getting too stoned or having any unwanted side effects. Even so, it’s important to be conscious of these potential risks and make sure that you don’t overdo it.</p><p>Finally, marijuana can also provide a sense of relaxation for those who are constantly under stress. Whether it’s related to their celebrity life or personal troubles, cannabis can help stars find some peace of mind — even if only for a few hours at a time. With all this in mind, it’s no wonder why celebrities like smoking marijuana and getting high on weed.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9 Celebrities You Didn’t Know that Smoke Marijuana</h2><p>The use of marijuana and weed by celebrities has been a topic of debate for many years.
