The first part of the lyrics depicts a girl who was once young, bohemian, and full of life. The singer, perhaps someone who knows her intimately, watched her grow and eventually gained wisdom. The lines "Me and my heart, following the shadow she made," suggest that the singer may have pursued her, chasing her like the sun, but failed to keep up with her. As time passed, she became someone new, and the singer realized he broke the spell and got over her.</p><br><p>The second part of the lyrics mentions a "Troubleman" who wished it all away and found a path with a gun in hand. The reference to the "Troubleman" is vague and open to interpretation, but it could mean someone who sought trouble, or someone who had a difficult life. The lines "He's gotten bad for me, he's gotten bad for me," could refer back to the girl in the first part, emphasizing that the singer has moved on from her and into someone new. The repeated line "Oh, no. You go home, we go home," could mean that it's time to put the past behind us and move forward.</p><br><p>Overall, "Troubleman" is a poignant song that explores the complexities of love and growth. It's a song that speaks of overcoming obstacles and learning to let go of the past.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>She was young once,</u><br>Once we remember her as young</p><br><p><u>Girl of the bohemian kind.</u><br>She was a free-spirited girl who didn't conform to social conventions</p><br><p><u>In the cold, bright dawn,</u><br>During a chilly and brightly lit morning</p><br><p><u>We watched her grow.</u><br>We observed her development and evolution</p><br><p><u>Wisdom began,</u><br>She started to become wise</p><br><p><u>Season when the river was high.</u><br>During a time when the river was full and overflowing</p><br><p><u>On the gray stone long,</u><br>Walking on a long gray stone</p><br><p><u>I walked alone.</u><br>I journeyed by myself</p><br><p><u>Me and my heart,</u><br>Myself and my emotions</p><br><p><u>Following the shadow she made.</u><br>Pursuing her and her influence</p><br><p><u>Like a dull sky day,</u><br>A completely gray sky and mundane day</p><br><p><u>I chased the sun.</u><br>I pursued happiness and fulfillment</p><br><p><u>Back at the start,</u><br>Returning to the beginning</p><br><p><u>I was still in love with the way.</u><br>I still long for her previous ways</p><br><p><u>It's a long way,</u><br>The distance is significant</p><br><p><u>From what's become.</u><br>From the status quo</p><br><p><u>She's got it bad for me,</u><br>She has strong romantic feelings towards me</p><br><p><u>The only game she played,</u><br>Her only goal was to be with me</p><br><p><u>Now, turn the other way.</u><br>Now she has a change of heart and is distancing herself from me</p><br><p><u>Newly grown up,</u><br>She has recently matured</p><br><p><u>Folded up the color he wore.</u><br>She discarded clothing items that remind her of a past lover</p><br><p><u>See the all new girl,</u><br>Observe the brand new version of her</p><br><p><u>Rehearsed and well.</u><br>She is practiced and polished in her new persona</p><br><p><u>Filling my cup,</u><br>She is giving me joy and fulfillment</p><br><p><u>Playing at the edge of the shore.</u><br>She is performing at the beach's extremity</p><br><p><u>See the way she moves,</u><br>Observe the way she dances and carries herself</p><br><p><u>I broke the spell.</u><br>I broke out of her captivating charm</p><br><p><u>Oh, no.</u><br>Uh oh</p><br><p><u>Try to fix it for you, break it then it's gone.</u><br>I attempted to repair the damage for her, but ended up destroying it all</p><br><p><u>I go home, I go home.</u><br>I am returning home</p><br><p><u>Troubleman,</u><br>A person who has a proclivity for trouble</p><br><p><u>You wished it all away.</u><br>You longed for everything to disappear</p><br><p><u>Gun in hand,</u><br>Holding a firearm</p><br><p><u>You found a path today.</u><br>You discovered a new path today</p><br><p><u>And I know, nothing about.</u><br>I do not have any knowledge of what is happening</p><br><p><u>Your faith was long ago.</u><br>Your trust and beliefs are distant and far in the past</p><br><p><u>Foreign land,</u><br>A faraway and unfamiliar land</p><br><p><u>The sea was made of stone.</u><br>The ocean was as solid as rock</p><br><p><u>He's gotten bad for me,</u><br>He developed a bad habit for me</p><br><p><u>The only game he played,</u><br>He was solely focused on winning me over</p><br><p><u>Now, turn the other way.</u><br>He has now turned his back on me</p><br><p><u>Troubleman,</u><br>A person who has a proclivity for trouble</p><br><p><u>We used to shake a bed.</u><br>We used to have sex in a bed that would rock with us</p><br><p><u>Ship unmanned,</u><br>A vessel lost its crew</p><br><p><u>The rain was just ahead.</u><br>The rain was approaching</p><br><p><u>What troubleman,</u><br>What trouble does this man cause</p><br><p><u>Is just the empty name.</u><br>He isn't as ominous and troublesome as his name implies</p><br><p><u>You go home, we go home.</u><br>We are all returning home</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Contributed by Annabelle H.
