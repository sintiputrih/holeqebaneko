Building the telescope was a massive undertaking for NASA, one that took about 20 years and $10 billion.

But this is just the beginning. More James Webb Telescope images will be arriving for as long as the observatory lasts, perhaps for up to 10 years.</p><p>Experts have estimated that the universe is about 13.8 billion years old, and the hope is that the James Webb Space Telescope can explore as much of that cosmic history as possible.

But the James Webb Space Telescope didn't even get its official name until 2002.</p><p>Things only got more complicated from there. From unexpected changes in the telescope's construction to delayed launches to the ever-rising cost of building the observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope took far longer than expected to launch. As the price steadily rose to $10 billion, it became more and more crucial that the expensive device would not fail.</p><p>And ahead of the long-awaited launch, some expressed concerns about the telescope's very name. Though the real James Webb was an important leader at NASA from 1961 to 1968 — overseeing the <a href=# rel=noopener>historic Apollo program</a> — the administrator also allowed discrimination against gay government employees during his tenure. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to NPR</a>, there is no current plan to change the name, but it remains controversial in some scientific circles.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-401534 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/james-webb-guiana-payload.jpg alt="James Webb Telescope Images" width=600 height=900 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-401534 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>JODY AMIET/AFP via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>The James Webb Space Telescope at The Guiana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guiana on November 5, 2021.</span></p><p>But despite all the conflicts over the price, timeline, and name, many experts were pleased to see that the telescope's launch from French Guiana in 2021 was a resounding success. And now that the observatory is deep in the cosmos, experts are able to enjoy the many perks that it has to offer.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>As reported by NASA</a>, the James Webb Space Telescope is an infrared observatory, meaning that it can view the cosmos at infrared wavelengths. Though the telescope is far from the first device to use infrared technology, it boasts the most sensitive infrared camera that's ever been sent into deep space, the famed Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam).</p><p>This allows us to observe parts of the universe that have never been captured by other telescopes, not even the <a href=# rel=noopener>iconic Hubble</a>. Indeed, the Webb has already sent us some of the clearest pictures of space that we've ever seen, helping us unlock the mysteries of the universe.</p><h2>Why James Webb Telescope Images Are So Important To Astronomers</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>As reported by Newsweek</a>, the James Webb Space Telescope is about three times bigger than the Hubble. And thanks to its massive 21-foot-wide primary mirror, the Webb also has the ability to observe cosmic objects that are nearly nine times fainter than the objects the Hubble was able to see.</p><p>While the new telescope's NIRCam has gotten a lot of attention, it also boasts three other state-of-the-art instruments: the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), and the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph/Fine Guidance Sensor (NIRISS/FGS).</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>According to the Space Telescope Science Institute</a>, these instruments all have different modes of observing objects in space. And while some may be best suited for certain phenomena, they can all be used to capture nearly anything in the cosmos, from far-off galaxies to our very own solar system.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-401535 alt="James Webb Space Telescope" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/james-webb-in-space.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-401535 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>NASA/Webb</span><span class=caption-body>One of the last views of the James Webb Space Telescope after its launch into space.</span></p><p>But all of these impressive upgrades don't mean that scientists are forgetting about the Hubble. After all, the famous telescope is still in operation. Furthermore, experts are able to combine the powers of the Hubble and the Webb to create even more striking images of the universe.</p><p>Along with complementing and expanding upon some of the discoveries that the Hubble has already made, the James Webb Space Telescope is also meant to find the earliest galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. Additionally, it will tell us more about the births of stars and planets.</p><p>Further down the line, some experts also hope to use the telescope to find out more about the mysterious dark matter that helps sculpt other components of the universe. The telescope may be able to find an alien biosphere on another Earth-like planet — if such a biosphere exists. It even has the potential to determine the actual rate at which space is expanding.</p><p>On top of answering centuries-old questions, astronomers also hope that the James Webb Telescope images will raise new questions in the future. Clearly, we still have so much more to learn about the universe.</p><p>After looking through these James Webb Telescope images, learn about <a href=#>Edwin Hubble</a>, the namesake of the Hubble Space Telescope.
