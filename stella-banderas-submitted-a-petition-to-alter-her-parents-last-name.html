In Los Angeles, the woman has just demanded and submitted a petition for a name change. Stella desired to be known by the name Stella del Carmen Banderas. She indicated on the forms that she want to reduce the size of her name. Additionally, she admits that she seldom uses the Griffith. Stella emphasized that omitting her surname would be consistent with her usual use.</p><h2>Stella Has Two Half-Siblings</h2><p>Stella is also related to Alexander Bauer, her half-brother. Stella’s brother and sister both descend from her mother. Stella’s half-sister was born to Stella’s mother Melanie and her ex-partner Don Johnson.

The photo of the pair posted on Instagram by Stella’s biological mother is breathtaking. The couple has been together for a few months, and Melanie couldn’t be happier for her daughter.&nbsp;Stella wore a crimson and black floor-length dress with straight, middle-parted hair made of silk, while her partner wore a black tuxedo. Eli held Stella by the waist. They were all geared up to attend the Academy Awards. The image was inundated with comments including phrases such as lovely lovers, kisses from Spain, and many more.</p><h2>Her father has said that he would always adore her mother.</h2><p>Before divorcing in December 2015, his parents, Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith were married for over two decades. Even though they are no longer in a relationship, Banderas considers Griffith to be his closest friend, and he will always adore her. During a 2018 interview with People, Banderas discussed his relationship with his ex-wife Melanie.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Stella-Banderas-3.jpg alt="Stella Banderas" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He said that even though they are divorced, she is still a member of the family and he would always love her. They have maintained touch over the years and believe they have handled their separation with grace, which, according to him, their children, who are their focus, are also enjoying. When questioned about Stella and whether he would want to see his daughter on TV, he said that he would back her in whatever endeavor she chose.</p><h2>Stella Banderas Parent Relation</h2><p>In 1995, Antonio and Melanie met on the set of Two Much, in which they both starred.&nbsp;But Antonio was taken by her beauty the moment he saw her on the red carpet of the 1989 Academy Awards, and he even asked Spanish filmmaker Pedro her name.&nbsp;And six years later, they were working together as a couple on the set of Two Much.</p><p>The pair first believed it was only an infatuation since they were both married to their respective husbands, but within a year, they divorced their respective marriages after recognizing it was more than a passing fling.&nbsp;They were married in London on May 14, 1996. Five months later, they welcomed their daughter Stella into the world.&nbsp;Antonio said at the time while discussing their parenting styles, that Melanie was more strict with the child than he was. Antonio said at the time that his daughter was taking advantage of him due to the fact that she was his first child.</p><p>After sustaining a knee injury in 2000, Melanie relapsed into substance use.&nbsp;She had previously been addicted to cocaine and alcohol and had entered treatment in her late 80s.&nbsp;Melanie mentioned in an interview that nobody would have been more supportive of her in difficult moments than Antonio.&nbsp;On the other hand, Antonio recognized that the relationship was on the point of dissolution and that it would terminate if she did not overcome her addiction.&nbsp;The pair filed for divorce in June 2014, alleging irreconcilable differences, and simultaneously participated in the science fiction thriller Automata.&nbsp;Their divorce was completed in December of 2015.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqrZ2coa5ursCnm56qkah6tMHBpqCtrJWZeqJ5z56roqyZpLtuwM5mmKWslad6qbHRZqeaqpWjwbR5y5qqrWWelrqmew%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstella-banderas-submitted-a-petition-to-alter-her-parents-last-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstella-banderas-submitted-a-petition-to-alter-her-parents-last-name.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstella-banderas-submitted-a-petition-to-alter-her-parents-last-name.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstella-banderas-submitted-a-petition-to-alter-her-parents-last-name.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstella-banderas-submitted-a-petition-to-alter-her-parents-last-name.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstella-banderas-submitted-a-petition-to-alter-her-parents-last-name.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-janet-jackson-super-bowl-controversy-with-justin-timberlake-explained.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-janet-jackson-super-bowl-controversy-with-justin-timberlake-explained.html>The Janet Jackson Super Bowl controversy with Justin Timberlake, explained</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bob-odenkirk-net-worth-how-much-does-the-better-call-saul-star-make.html>Bob Odenkirk Net Worth: How Much Does the Better Call Saul Star Make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bob-odenkirk-net-worth-how-much-does-the-better-call-saul-star-make.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
