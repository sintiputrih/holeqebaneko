Get the details...&nbsp;</p><h2>Michael Douglas' early career and first marriage</h2><p id=eVAvPqEStZp data-wc=64>But Michael didn't always have it so easy. After finding television success with in the early Seventies, Michael faced an uphill battle in landing film roles. Enter Kathleen Turner, whose on-screen chemistry meshed with Michael's in three movies, and making Mr Douglas a hot big-screen property at last.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4a00c712dc7-michael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones.jpg><p id=efWtloI5WDw data-wc=71>At Jimmy Carter's pre-inaugural party in 1977, Democrat supporter Michael, who is now a UN Messenger Of Peace and campaigns for nuclear reform, met then-19-year-old Georgetown sophomore Diandra Luker. Three months later the couple were married and shortly after Diandra gave birth to the couple's only child, Cameron. Despite two separations, rumours of infidelity, and a 1993 stint in rehab, Michael remained married to Diandra until mid-1995, when the two separated.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f38932ce2943-michael-douglas-diandra-luker-d.jpg><p id=eYZy1RVSWX data-wc=33>The pair officially divorced in June 2000 amid rumours the star had been forced to hand over half of his $100-million-plus fortune as the two had not signed a pre-nup agreement.</p><p id=extOTbM4mE_ data-wc=13><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Michael Douglas caught off guard in unexpected beach selfie with Catherine Zeta-Jones</a></strong></p><p id=eqX9ul0AmlI data-wc=13><span style=font-family:Montserrat,sans-serif;font-size:15px;background-color:initial;box-sizing:border-box;font-weight:bolder><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><a class="hm-link hm-link" href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones is nothing but legs in new photo by the pool</a><br></strong></p><h2>Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones' relationship</h2><p id=e2sKQNfzWmp data-wc=107>Michael and Catherine initially denied that they were an item, until photos were published of the two of them canoodling in the swimming pool of Michael's Majorca hideaway. The two tied the knot in New York on November 18, 2000, after a two-year courtship. The couple have a son, Dylan Michael, who was born in 2000, and a daughter, Carys Zeta Douglas, welcomed in 2003. The pair made headlines are reportedly living separately in 2013, with Catherine's rep confirming that they were "taking some time apart to evaluate and work on their marriage". However, the pair reconciled and moved back in together later in the same year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b6d6e7043b18-michael-douglas-with-children-dylan-and-carys.jpg><h2>Michael Douglas' son Cameron's drug charges and prison stay</h2><p id=e8Rmuqlhtcb data-wc=78>In 2010, Michael's son Cameron was sentenced to five years behind bars after being found guilty of heroin possession and conspiracy to deal large quantities of methamphetamine and cocaine. "I love my son but I'm not blind to his actions," Michael wrote in a letter to the New York judge. "He is an adult and responsible for his own actions. We do know, however, that genes, family and peer pressure are a strong influence on a substance abuser."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6bb20932efd1-cameron-douglas-kids.jpg><p id=eEoX1JF93p data-wc=68>His stepmother Catherine wrote: "What is wrong is wrong, but may all these positive attitudes prevail", while Kirk, who was 93 at the time, admitted it was his last wish to see his grandson put his troubles behind him. "I am convinced that Cameron could be a fine actor and a person that cares for others. I hope I can see that happen before I die," he said.</p><p id=eXifVmrvIT data-wc=86>In 2011, Cameron's prison sentence was extended after he pleaded guilty to possessing drugs in prison. He was also injured during his incarceration when his leg was broken by another inmate. He was released early in 2016, and lived in a halfway house after serving a seven-year sentence. In 2019, he released an autobiography, Long Way Home, about his experiences with drug abuse. Michael is now also a grandfather, as Cameron has welcomed two children, a six-year-old daughter and son, three, with his girlfriend, Viviane Thibes.</p><h2>Michael Douglas' health</h2><p id=ehCnlO3SEu data-wc=81>Shortly after Cameron's initial prison sentence, it emerged the actor was battling tongue cancer, although he originally claimed it was throat cancer on the advise of his doctor. As he prepared to undergo eight weeks of radiation and chemotherapy on a tumour, the brave star announced: "I am very optimistic". His doctors, meanwhile, stated that the prognosis was good and a full recovery was expected. According to the Oral Cancer Foundation, Michael is now cancer free, and regularly undergoes remission check-ups.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1e3eb73bb365-michael-douglas-catherine-zeta-jones-bafta.jpg> <span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9tbGlkuqqvx5qcpWWUpMKouMCsZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmichael-douglas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmichael-douglas.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmichael-douglas.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmichael-douglas.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmichael-douglas.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmichael-douglas.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./new-court-documents-allege-britney-spears-father-made-millions-off-the-conservatorship-and-monitored-her-therapy-notes.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./new-court-documents-allege-britney-spears-father-made-millions-off-the-conservatorship-and-monitored-her-therapy-notes.html>New court documents allege Britney Spears father made millions off the conservatorship and monito</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./in-loving-memory-of-paxton-newell-obituary-utah-community-mourns.html>In Loving Memory of Paxton Newell Obituary: Utah Community Mourns</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./in-loving-memory-of-paxton-newell-obituary-utah-community-mourns.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
