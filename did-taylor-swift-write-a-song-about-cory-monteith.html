Haunted</p><p>A reflection on the boy that got away, Haunted is about an amalgamation of several boys, says Swift. The liner hint is “STILL TO THIS DAY,” and the lyrics are vague enough that it could be about any past relationship. Joe Jonas makes sense, but she could have had any number of boys on her mind as she wrote it.</p><p>What did Taylor Swift say when Cory Monteith died? “Speechless. And for the worst reason,” the ‘Red’ superstar tweeted, clearly in a state of shock. Swift was brief in her reaction, and has yet to say anything else in reaction to Monteith’s untimely death. The pair were acquainted, having been rumored to have dated briefly in 2010.</p><p>Besides, Who was White Horse written about?</p><p>Swift and Rose composed the song about one of Swift’s ex-boyfriends, when Swift discovered he was not what she had perceived of him. It focused on the moment where Swift accepted that the relationship was over. “White Horse” is, musically, a country song and uses sparse production to emphasize vocals.</p><p>Beside above, What happened with Taylor Swift and Dianna Agron?</p><p>While fans would love to believe that these two are ex-lovers, Swift and Agron have never confirmed a relationship happened.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Haunted_about_Jake_Gyllenhaal></span><strong>Is Haunted about Jake Gyllenhaal?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>It’s been over a year since Jake Gyllenhaal dumped Taylor Swift — ending their three-month romance just before New Year’s — and the country crooner, 22, isn’t over it, pals tell Us Weekly. “She’s haunted by that relationship,” a source tells Us, adding that Gyllenhaal, 31, “totally screwed with her mind.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_do_you_mean_by_Haunted></span><strong>What do you mean by Haunted?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>adjective. inhabited or frequented by ghosts: a haunted castle. preoccupied, as with an emotion, memory, or idea; obsessed: His haunted imagination gave him no peace. disturbed; distressed; worried: Haunted by doubt he again turned to law books on the subject.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Haunted_by_Taylor_Swift_a_cover></span><strong>Is Haunted by Taylor Swift a cover?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taylor Swift – Haunted (Cover by THL) – YouTube.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_they_explain_Finn%E2%80%99s_death_on_Glee></span><strong>How did they explain Finn’s death on Glee?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The details of the 31-year-old actor’s fatal overdose of heroin and alcohol have been reported extensively, but Finn’s cause of death wasn’t revealed to viewers. “That doesn’t matter,” insisted Kurt (Chris Colfer) in the episode titled “The Quarterback,” which opened “three weeks to the day” after Finn’s funeral.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_old_was_Cory_Monteith_when_he_died></span><strong>How old was Cory Monteith when he died?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>On July 13, 2013, Monteith was found dead in his room at the Fairmont Pacific Rim hotel in Vancouver.
