Biro who was once featured on the cover of Playboy magazine and whose father is Kip King, whose real name is Jerome Kattan.&nbsp;His family is said to be Jewish and their lineage is a mix of Iraqi, Hungarian and Polish.&nbsp;He has a half-brother named Andrew Joslyn.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-chris-kattan-gay-or-does-he-have-a-wife></span><strong><span>Is Chris Kattan gay or does he have a wife?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>To our knowledge, it is unlikely that Chris Kattan is gay.&nbsp;The American actor and comedian was once married to model, Sunshine Deia Tutt.&nbsp;Chris married the model in 2008 in Oakhurst, Calif., after two years of dating.</span></p><p><span>Kattan’s proposal to Tutt was very romantic as it is said that he surprisingly asked her to marry him on Christmas Eve 2006 at his grandmother’s house in Gainesville, Texas.&nbsp;However, the romantic relationship between the newlyweds was short-lived as they filed for divorce just two months into their marriage.&nbsp;Although they did not reveal to the public the reasons why they wanted to cancel their union, recent reports suggest that Kattan’s wife cheated on him.&nbsp;Besides, other sources claim that Chris Kattan was also cheating on her and it was his idea to end the marriage.</span></p><p><span>Prior to his marriage, Kattan was in quite a number of relationships which include dating model and actress Jennifer Gimenez between 1999 and two years later in 2001 he was in a relationship with Jennifer Coolidge.&nbsp;Chris Kattan also dated comedian/actress named Maya Rudolph</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-did-he-break-his-neck></span><strong><span>How did he break his neck?</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Chris Kattan recently announced the reason behind his stiff appearance when he revealed that he suffered a serious neck injury that required four surgeries.&nbsp;From what he revealed, he has been recovering from his injury for 20 years now.&nbsp;Kattan’s physical appearance, which showed he was a little stiff&nbsp;</span><span>in Dancing With The Stars</span><span>&nbsp;(DWTS) premiere, was what prompted him to eventually let people talk about what he’s been up against.&nbsp;However, the comedian didn’t reveal all the details of her injury, instead referring to anything that drove her as a “stunt”.</span></p><p><span>As a contestant on the DWTS show, Kattan remembers being stopped by a judge, but it was a Herculean task for him, as his posture was default stiff due to his injury.</span></p><p><span>However, his dance partner Carson has praised his relentless efforts and although she too is worried about him, Kattan has no intention of letting his injury be robbed to get him on the show.&nbsp;For him, being part of the show as a way to renew his zeal.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=height-of-kattan></span><strong><span>Height of Kattan</span></strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>This performer has a height of 5 feet 5.5 inches and his weight is placed at 70 kg.&nbsp;The comedian is also distinguished by his striking blue eye and dark brown hair.</span></p><p class=postsid
